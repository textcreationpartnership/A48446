            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Could with as little paines and travail have journyed to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to have taken a view of the Temple, had it now ſtood, as this hath coſt me to ſurvey it by the eyes of others in their writings, as I have done: And for all my labour, how I ſhall ſpeed in the acceptance of the Reader, I muſt leave it to the common doubtfull fate of Books, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to beg it, nor to deſpair of it. If I have come ſhort either of the worth of the matter treated of, or failed the expectation of the Reader, the difficulty of the Subject may plead my Apology, and my deſire to benefit, may ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my cenſure.</p>
            <p>There is hardly a harder taske in Study then to deſcribe ſtructures and places not ſeen, and at diſtance; and the Scripture hath hardly a more obſcure deſcription of any thing then of this fabricke. In that I have added ſo much of Jewiſh intelligence about it, it is becauſe I finde not where better information (after the Scriptures) is to be had.
<pb facs="tcp:49920:4"/>I know they hear as ill as any men for their writings, and that very oft not without very good cauſe, yet give them leave to tell the ſtory of their own cuſtoms and antiquities aſſoone as another man, and if you will not beleeve them what they ſay, to produce others that ſpeak more credibly, in the matter in hand I beleeve will be next impoſſible.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not plead for them in all they write, leſt I ſhould be like unto them; in things of hiſtoricall nature, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but give ſome credence to them, as being likely to be the beſt recorders of their owne Antiquities.</p>
            <p>It is well knowne to the ſtudious how much light hath been held out by ſome learned men towards the explication of abundance of difficulties in Scripture, by the diſcovery of the Jewiſh cuſtomes and Antiquities, to which the New Testament ſpeaketh and alludeth exceeding copiouſly and frequently: I need not to goe far for examples of learned men that have been choicely happy in ſuch illuſtrations: A matchleſſe paire in our owne Nation, ſecond to none in any Nation whatſoever, Mr. <hi>Hugh Broughton</hi> in the laſt generation, and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in this, may be inſtances ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. Now though it is farre enough from my thoughts and hopes to dream of atchieving to the leaſt degree and meaſure of their skil in theſe ſtudies, and their happineſs in ſuch explanations: yet can I not but from ſuch incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of experience in others, go on with the more delight in the peruſall of ſuch Monuments my ſelfe, not without hope that I may reape ſome profit by them to my ſelfe, and hold out ſomething from them which may not be altogether uſeleſſe to others.</p>
            <p>What may redound of this kinde out of this preſent vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, I muſt leave to the Readers cenſure, and not be my owne judge: This I hope <hi>I</hi> may ſay of it without arrogance or falſhood, that this Subject hath ſcarcely been ſo largely
<pb facs="tcp:49920:4"/>handled in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue heretofore, and that what is here produced out of Jewiſh records, doth for the moſt part carry ſo faire poſsibility and probability with it, and is ſo little diſſonant either to Scripture or reaſon, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> whoſe credit is commonly reputed above <hi>Talmudicall,</hi> that if on the one hand there is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable ground to beleeve it, neither is there on the other hand, undeniable ground to gainſay it.</p>
            <p>I had undertaken a taske of a far larger time, toile, and volume, and the ſame way of workmanſhip that I have done this; namely, from Scripture, and from Talmudicall and Jewiſh writers, to have given a deſcription of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo far am I ſatisfied of the benefit of theſe Authors if dexterouſly managed. And certainly if my judgement do not much faile me, exceeding ſingular uſe might be made of them in ſuch a worke, and hundreds or rather thouſands of learned rarities as to that Subject pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of them, not to be found in any Authors but themſelves, which tend not a little to the illuſtration of the chorography and ſtory of that Land: But when I had ſpent a good large time and progreſſe in that worke, I found that I was happily prevented in that Subject by a more learned and acute pen;<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Tho. Fuller, B. D.</note> which though it went not the ſame way in that worke that I had done, yet was it ſo farre before me both in progreſs and in accuracy, that <hi>I</hi> knew it would be loſt labour for me to proceed further. Hereupon I left off that taske, leſt I ſhould <hi>actum agere,</hi> and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my thoughts to this ſurvey, becauſe of a promiſe which had a tie upon me for ſomething of this nature.</p>
            <p>With the working up of this piece, I alſo drew up a large Map of the Temple structures, according to the verball deſcription of them in this volume, the ſight and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of which would have made the things here deſcribed
<pb facs="tcp:49920:5"/>a great deale more eaſie and pleaſant to be understood, could it have been publiſhed; but I have not yet met with the faculty and fortune of bringing it to that iſſue: and I thought to have ſuppreſſed this Tract till that alſo might have come forth with it; but I have been overcome to let it out, partly by the importunity of others, and partly by this Reaſon of mine owne, that it might not be amiſſe to try what acceptance this Treatiſe will finde, before I adde more paines and charge for the ingraving of the Map. If any of my learned friends upon peruſall of this Tract, ſhall thinke the publication of that may be materiall, I ſhall be ready to embrace ſuch animation, and uſe my beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to effect the thing if it will be effected.</p>

He ſaith, that <hi>of the foure Gates upon this Weſtern quarter, one led towards the Kings Palace,</hi> (that is <hi>Shallecheth</hi> that we have viewed already) <hi>and the two next,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>into the Suburbs.</hi> Theſe <hi>Suburbs</hi> that he meaneth, were indeed that part of the City which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called <hi>Millo,</hi> which was the valley at the Weſt end of Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> in which Jeruſalem and <hi>Sion</hi> met and ſaluted each other, repleniſhed with buildings by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> in their times, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.9. &amp; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.27. and taken in as part and Suburbs of <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſo owned alwayes in after times.</p>
                  <p>And to this purpoſe is the expreſſion of <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his words that we have in hand, obſervable, when he ſaith, that two of theſe Weſterne gates were into the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Take the word <hi>Parbar</hi> therefore in either of the ſignifications that have been mentioned, either for an <hi>outer place,</hi> or for the <hi>Suburbs;</hi> this Gate that we have in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey might very properly be called by that name, becauſe it was a paſſage from the Temple into <hi>Millo,</hi> which was an ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place, and the Suburbs of <hi>Sion</hi> diſtinguiſhed and parted from <hi>Sion</hi> by a wall, yet a member of it, and belonging to it.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the other gate that ſtood next to this that we are about, toward the South, did lead alſo into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs as well as this, as is apparent from <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> yet is it not called by the ſame name <hi>Parbar:</hi> the reaſon of this may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe it bare a name pecullar and proper, ſutable to that ſingular uſe to which it was deſigned, or to that place where it was ſet, rather then ſutable to that place whither it gave paſſage.</p>
                  <p>And here becauſe we are in mention of the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> it may not be amiſſe to looke a little upon that text, that ſpeaketh of the Suburbs, and out of which we have taken that ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word <hi>Parbar,</hi> namely 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.11. It is ſaid
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49920:18"/>there, that <hi>Joſiah tooke away the Horſes that the Kings of Judah had given to the Sunne, at the entring in of the Houſe of the Lord, by the Chamber of Nathan mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>h the Chamberlaine which was in the Suburbs.</hi> Whether theſe Horſes were given to the Sunne, to be ſacrificed to it, or to ride on to meet and ſalute the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, as the Jewes ſuppoſe, we ſhall not trouble our ſelves to enquire into, it is the place that we have to looke after at this time, rather then the thing.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Stables of ſuch Horſes, (and it is like the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stables were in the ſame place) are ſaid to be in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs,</hi> and at the <hi>entring in of the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> and we cannot better allot the place, then that whereupon wee are, namely that they ſtood here in <hi>Millo,</hi> before this gate <hi>Parbar,</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and from thence there was a way to bring the Horſes up to the Kings houſe, when the Kings would uſe either thoſe horſes that they had dedicated to the Sun for their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious uſe, or their other Horſes for their common uſe. As they went out of <hi>Millo</hi> to riſe up into <hi>Sion,</hi> they paſſed through a gate which was in the wall that parted betweene <hi>Millo</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> which wall and gate was but a little below the Cauſey that went up to the gate <hi>Shallecheth:</hi> and this help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to underſtand that paſſage about <hi>Athaliahs</hi> death, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.11. <hi>They layd bands on her, and ſhe went by the way by which the Horſes came into the Kings houſe, and there ſhe was ſlaine.</hi> That is, they got her out of the Mountaine of the Temple, brought her downe by the gate <hi>Shallecheth</hi> and the Cauſey, and when ſhe came neare the horſe gate, through which the horſes went up out of the Stables in <hi>Millo,</hi> to the Kings houſe, there they ſlew her. There was a <hi>Horſe gate</hi> indeed in the maine wall of the City, on the Faſt part of it, <hi>Neb.</hi> 3.28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.39. but that was diſtinct from this, which was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar for the Kings horſes, and therefore a diſtinctive character is ſet upon this, namely, that it was the <hi>Horſe gate towards the Kings, houſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.15. It ſhould be rendred <hi>towards the Kings houſe</hi> rather then <hi>by the Kings houſe,</hi> for neither of theſe gates, either that on the Eaſt which was a gate of the City, nor this on the Weſt which was a gate into <hi>Millo,</hi> were neare the Kings houſe, but a good diſtance off; See the LXX there.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. 3.</hi> The two Gates and Houſe of Aſuppim.</head>
                  <p>IN the ſtory of the deſigning of the Porters to their ſeverall places and charges, in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.15, 17. it is ſaid thus, <hi>To Obed Edem Southward, and to his ſonnes the Houſe of Aſuppim. Eaſtward were ſixe Levites, Northward foure a day, Southward foure a day, and toward Aſuppim two and two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there are two things, that have juſtly moved divers learned men to conceive, that <hi>Aſuppim</hi> doth betoken the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries of the Temple, or the places where the offered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate things were referved and laid up. The one is the ſignification of the word it ſelfe, for it betokeneth <hi>gatherings</hi> or collections; and the other is, becauſe <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> whoſe ſonnes are ſaid here to be at <hi>Aſuppim</hi> as at their charge, is ſaid in 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 25.24. to have had the keeping of the treaſury. For there it is recorded that <hi>Joaſh the King of Iſrael tooke all the gold and ſilver and Veſſels that were found in the houſe of God with Obed Edom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if this be granted, that <hi>Aſuppim</hi> did betoken and mean the treaſuries, yet are we ſtill to ſeeke where <hi>Aſuppim</hi> was, and indeed there is not a more difficult matter, in all the ſurvey of the Temple, and of the buildings and affaires, belonging to it, then to determine aright and clearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Porters, treaſuries and treaſures and all their charges; there is ſo much variety of expreſſions about theſe in Scripture, and ſo little explanation and reſolution of this matter in other writers, we ſhall do the beſt we can for their diſcovery as we come to the view of the ſeverall places that refer to any ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Aſuppim</hi> is uſed againe, in ſpeech concerning the Porters, <hi>Neh:</hi> 12.25. where fix men there named are ſaid to be Porters keeping the ward <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>at the Aſuppim of the Gates. Aben Ezra</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi> ſay it is but the ſame with <hi>Sippim</hi> the <hi>threſholds,</hi> and ſo it is rendred in our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49920:19"/>Engliſh Text. But if it be taken in that ſenſe in this place of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> that we have in hand, there can be no difference betweene the ſonnes of <hi>Obed Edom</hi> and the reſt of the Porters in this reſpect, for all of them may be ſaid to be Porters at <hi>Aſuppim</hi> as well as they, ſince they were all alike Porters at the <hi>threſholds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the naming of the Porters, and placing them in their ſtations, there are the Eaſt, Weſt, North and South quarters mentioned, and <hi>Aſuppim</hi> comes in as if it were out at all: At the Eaſt gate were ſix of <hi>Shelemiahs</hi> younger ſonnes; And his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Zechariah</hi> and his ſonnes at the North. At the Weſt were ſixe ſonnes of <hi>Hoſa</hi> and <hi>Shuppim,</hi> four at <hi>Shalle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,</hi> and two at <hi>Parbar.</hi> And four of <hi>Obed Edoms</hi> eight ſonnes at the South, and the other four at the <hi>houſe of Aſuppim,</hi> which ſeems out of ſquare and who can tell where?</p>
                  <p>For the ſearching out of this place, which lies ſo very covert, and obſcure in the Text, it may not be impertinent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe four particulars:
<list>
                        <item>1 That there were four gates on the Weſt ſide as hath been obſerved, namely the gate <hi>Coponius,</hi> two gates into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, and one into the City.</item>
                        <item>2. That the holy Ghoſt reckoning the Porters as they were diſpoſed after the returne out of captivity, placeth them only upon the four quarters of this outmoſt wall, 1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 9.23, 24. (for the wall that incompaſſed the Courts had no gate on the Weſt at all, and therefore thoſe verſes cannot be underſtood of that, but of this outmoſt boundary wall) And why ſhould we hold that he goeth in a different ſtyle here?</item>
                        <item>3 Thoſe Porters lodged round about the houſe of God, and opened the doores every morning, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.27. Now neither Prieſts nor Levites had any lodgings in the Gates of the Court, nor did the Levites open thoſe doores, but the Prieſts. And</item>
                        <item>4 That though there were four and twenty guards, three of Prieſts, and one and twenty of Levites every night about the Temple, yet was there not any ſuch by day at the Court gates, or at thoſe places by the Court wall where they were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49920:20"/>by night: But here the Text doth expreſly tell that theſe Porters atendance was by day.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things therefore conſidered, 1. Wee cannot place <hi>the Houſe of Aſuppim</hi> in any other part, then in ſome place in this outmoſt wall that incompaſſed the Mountaine of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> even as the reſt of the gates and the Porters ſtood. 2. The expreſſion uſed in the Text doth argue that theſe ſons of <hi>Obed Edom</hi> that ſtood Porters at <hi>Aſuppim</hi> artended in two places or at two gates, for he ſaith that at <hi>Aſuppim</hi> there were <hi>two and two.</hi> 3 Since the Porters at two of the gates only of the four that were on the Weſt quarter are named, namely, <hi>Shallecheth</hi> and <hi>Parbar,</hi> it cannot be otherwiſe conceived in reaſon, but that the other two gates on that quarter goe here under the name of <hi>Aſuppim,</hi> and had their Porters <hi>two and two.</hi> For 1. Since there were foure gates there, why ſhould two of them go without Porters, when all the reſt were ſo exactly manned? And 2 why ſhould we goe place theſe foure ſonnes of <hi>Obed Edom</hi> as Porters we know not where, and where wee never read of any Porters at all, and let theſe two gates ſtand wide and none to attend them?</p>
                  <p>I make no ſcruple therefore to conclude, that <hi>Aſuppim</hi> were the two gates in this Weſterne wall, which ſtood moſt South or neereſt to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>The houſe of Aſuppim,</hi> was a large piece of building, that ranne betweene them, which was a treaſury, or divers rooms for treaſuring and laying up ſomething for the uſe of the Temple. The treaſuries of the Temple were divers and in divers places, and committed to divers perſons; but the generall diſtinction of them is into the <hi>Treaſures of the Houſe of God, and the Treaſures of the dedicate things,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.20.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Treaſures of the houſe of God,</hi> is meant thoſe things that were in ordinary uſe and imploiment, as the veſſels, veſtments, tithes, wine, oile, and other things which were commonly uſed, and with theſe we may joine whatſoever was offered to the Treaſury either as due, as was the halfe ſhekel, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary as money or veſſels for the repaire of the houſe, and advancement of the Service. But by the <hi>Treaſures of dedicate things,</hi> is underſtood whatſoever the Kings, Captains or great
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49920:20"/>men had conſecrated and dedicated, which lay as the ſtocke of the Temple, and as the monuments of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. The former Treaſures were ſome of them under the care and charge of the Porters, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.26, 27, &amp;c. and the reſt and the latter, under the hand of other Levites, 1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 26.20, 22, 26, &amp;c. The Porters had their treaſuries at every one of their gates: and ſo ſhould I render <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>The Treaſuries of the Gates</hi> in Neh: 12.25. whereas ſome of them kept veſtments, ſome inſtruments, ſome one thing, and ſome another, and theſe ſonnes of <hi>Obed Edom</hi> kept the ſilver and gold veſſels, which were the richeſt utenſils of the Temple, and therefore their gates and the buildings between are called <hi>Aſuppim</hi> or <hi>Treaſuries,</hi> by an Emphaticall dignity above the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Before wee part with this Weſt quarter, let us take our proſpect outward as wee have done from the two ſides wee have been upon before. As you ſtood on the middle of this wall, <hi>Millo</hi> lay before you, and there might you ſee, beſides the Kings ſtables and other buildings, the poole of <hi>Siloam,</hi> and the Kings Gardens: On the left hand was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of <hi>Acra</hi> and the buildings of <hi>Jeruſulem</hi> upon it: on the right hand, the riſing of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the ſtaires that went up into the City, and by which the King came downe to <hi>Shallecheth,</hi> and ſo into the Temple. And as you roſe higher was the place of the Sepulchers of <hi>Davids</hi> family, and another poole, <hi>Neb:</hi> 3.15, 16.</p>

               <p>Thus lay <hi>The Mountaine of the Lords houſe,</hi> incompaſſed with the City round about, and encloſed with a faire and high wall which ſeparated it from the common ground: On the one ſide of it lay <hi>Sion</hi> the ſeat of the King, on the other ſide <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the habitation of the people and the Temple, and its ſervice in the middle between, even as the miniſtery is in mediation betwixt God and his people. The wall that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed it, had eight gates of goodly ſtructure and beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fabrick, all of one faſhion, ſave only that the North and Eaſt gates were not topped the one in height, and the other in faſhion as the other were. At all of theſe gates were Porters by day, and at five of them were guards by night, as we ſhall obſerve hereafter: the acceſſe to them on the Eaſt and Weſt was by a great aſcent, but facilitated by ſteps or cauſeys for the peoples eaſe, and for the comming up of the beaſts that were to be ſacrificed, of which there were ſome that came up dayly. On the South ſide the aſcent was not ſo very great, yet it had its riſing in the like manner of acceſſe as had the other. On the North what coming up there was, it was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49920:22"/>more for the accommodation of the reſidents in the Tower <hi>Antonia,</hi> then for the entrance into the <hi>Temple,</hi> the North gate <hi>Tedi</hi> being of ſo little uſe as hath been ſpoken.</p>
               <p>At any of the gates as you paſſed through, the entrance it ſelf, through which you went, was ten cubits wide, twenty cubits high, and twelve cubits over, ſixe of which cubits were without the holy ground, and ſix within: and as you entered in at the Eaſt gate, had you ſeen the ground before any buildings were ſet in it, or any thing done to it, but only the building of this wall, you might have ſeen the hill riſing from the Eaſt to the Weſt, in ſuch an aſcent, that the Weſterne part of it was very many cubits higher then where you ſtood, as we ſhall have occaſion to obſerve as wee paſſe along.</p>
               <p>This banke was once well ſtored with buſhes and bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Gen:</hi> 22.13. and afterward with worſe briers and thorns, the Jebuſites, who had it in poſſeſſion till <hi>David</hi> purchaſed it for that divine uſe and ſtructure, that we are looking after: Here was then a poore threſhing floore of <hi>Ornan the Jebuſite,</hi> but afterward the habitation of the God of <hi>Jacob:</hi> A place and fabrick as ſumptuous and eminent, as it was poſſible for man, and art, and coſt to make it; the glory of the Nation where it was, and the wonder of all the Nations round about it; but in fine, as great a wonder and monument of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and ruine, as ever it had been of beauty and gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Before we ſtep further toward the ſurvey of it as it ſtood in glory, we muſt keep yet a while along this wal about which we have been ſo long, and obſerve ſome buildings and beauties that joined and belonged to it, beſides the gates that we have ſurveyed in it already.</p>

The rock it ſtood upon, was fifty cubits high and ſteep, and the building it ſelfe was forty cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits above it, it was 4 ſquare, incompaſſed with a wall of 3 cubits high, which encloſed its courts, and had a Turret at every corner, like the white Tower at <hi>London,</hi> but that it was more ſpacious, and that the Turrets were not all of a height, for thoſe at the North-eaſt and North-weſt corners were 50 cubits high, but thoſe on the South-eaſt and South-weſt were 70 cubits high, that they might fully over-looke the Temple. It had cloiſters or walkes about it, and baths and lodgings and large roomes in it, ſo that it was at once like a Caſtle and like a Palace. There was a paſſage out of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the North and Weſt cloiſters of the Mountain of the Houſe (of which we ſhall ſpeak next) and by that the Roman Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon Souldiers went downe at every feſtivall of the Jewes, to take care againſt tumults and ſeditions in thoſe great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes

                  <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> the High-prieſt the firſt of that name, tooke up this place for his Manſion, and for the laying up of his holy garments, and ſo did his ſucceſſors after him: And <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> when he repaired it and called it <hi>Antonia,</hi> he ſuffered the High-prieſts to lay up and to have the keeping of the robes here ſtill, and ſo did <hi>Archelaus</hi> his ſonne after him. But when the Romans put <hi>Archelaus</hi> from his Kingdome, they tooke the cuſtody of theſe garments into their owne power, but yet they let them lye in the ſame place, till <hi>Vitellius</hi> the <hi>Pro-conſul</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> (in the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi>) coming to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and well pleaſed with his entertainment there, upon the Jewes Petition reſtored the keeping of thoſe robes to them againe.

                  <hi>The houſe of the gate,</hi> is alſo moſt true concerning the proper ſignification of the Engliſh word Porch, for that moſt ordinarily and commonly is taken among us for the building over or before the houſe door. But theſe words that we are about, do ſignifie Cloiſter-walks or rows, where men uſed to walk or ſit free from rains and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one ſide open, ſupported with pillars, and all floored, or covered over head.</p>
               <p>So was this large compaſſe along the wall, it was double <hi>Cloiſtered</hi> round about (for give me leave to uſe that word, till I find a better) having a roofe or floore over head, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49920:24"/>lay almoſt as high as the top of the Wall, ſave what was left for the walls battlements: and it was ſupported with a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble row of Marble pillars (the inmoſt row joining to the wall) and it was diſtinguiſhed by the middle row of Pillars into a double walke. Wee need not goe farre for a copy, the ſtately new building (<hi>Piazza,</hi> walke, cloiſter, call it what you will) at the Weſt end of <hi>Pauls,</hi> may very well bee our patterne. For it was much about that height, twelve yards and an halfe; it joined on one ſide to the wall, as that to the Church, and was borne up with gallant white Marble Pillars: It was 30 cubits, or 15 yards broad; either walk, half that breadth pillars and all, and had battlements above the leads, both at the wall, and on the other ſide, as that at <hi>Pauls</hi> is creſted on the outſide. Where buildings ſtood out into the Mountaine of the Houſe (as we have obſerved they did) there theſe Cloiſters were carried accordingly: being either cut off at the building, if it ſtood 30 cubits out, or the one halfe or more of the Cloiſter cut off if the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were narrower, and the reſt of the Cloiſter carried on before it.</p>
               <p>Onely upon the South ſide of the Square there was ſome difference of the Walkes or Cloiſter from what was in the other parts.</p>

The inmoſt and the outmoſt walke of theſe three (that is, that that was next to the wall, and that that was outmoſt towards the open ſpace of the Mountain of the Houſe) were equall in height and breadth with the walks or Cloiſters on any of the other ſides, namely 15 cubits high and 15 cubits broad apeece: but the middlemoſt walke was 42 cubits and

               <p>Now in what part of the Mountaine of the Houſe <hi>Hhanoth</hi> or the <hi>Tabernae</hi> were placed, may be beſt conceived, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the place of the great <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> ſitting, before they came to ſit in the roome <hi>Gazith;</hi> And for this purpoſe a Text of <hi>Jeremy</hi> doth give us light, which is in <hi>chap.</hi> 35.4. where it is ſaid thus, <hi>I brought the Rechabites into the Houſe of the Lord, into the Chamber of the ſonnes of Hanan the ſonne of Igdaliah a man of God, which was by the chamber of the Princes, which was above the chamber of Maaſeiah the ſonne of Shallum the keeper of the doore.</hi> Now by the Princes we cannot underſtand the Princes of the bloud, for what had <hi>Jehojakims</hi> ſonnes to doe here? their reſidence was in the palaces of <hi>Sion,</hi> and their way into the Temple, was at the gate on the Weſt quarter, which was called <hi>Shalle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth</hi> and <hi>Coponius,</hi> whereas this gate whereof the ſon of <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> was keeper or porter, was the Eaſt gate, as is apparent from 1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 9.17, 18.</p>

               <p>The floore of the Mountaine of the Houſe was not even, but riſing from Eaſt to Weſt, ſo much in the whole,<note n="[a]" place="margin">Maym. in Beth habbechir. per. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> that the floore of the porch of the Temple was two and twenty cubits higher then the floore of the Gate <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> or the Eaſt gate in the outmoſt wall: which in equality was caſt into ſeverall levels one above another; and the outmoſt wall accordingly did ſometime runne levell, and ſometime riſe from levell to levell, even as the evenneſſe or riſings of the floore it ſelf did call for it.</p>
               <p>The meaſures of the Temple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> are ſaid to have been, <hi>by the firſt meaſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 3.3. that is, by the ſame cubit, that meaſured the firſt Tabernacle, which is the ſame that we fix upon; and by this meaſure to have beene ſeventy cubits long, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.2, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.3. in theſe ſeverall ſpaces. The moſt holy place twenty cubits, the holy place forty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49920:28"/>cubits and the Porch ten. And the breadth of all theſe was 20 cubits.</p>
               <p>About the height there is ſome obſcurity, for the booke of <hi>Kings</hi> ſaith it was 30 cubits, but the booke of <hi>Chronicles</hi> nameth no ſumme at all; onely it ſaith that the Porch was 120 cubits high. Now<note n="[b]" place="margin">Kunch. in les. allegat.</note> 
                  <hi>David Kimchi</hi> doth diſpute it, whether this was the height of the Porch onely, or of the whole houſe throughout: and he ſhews how it maybe conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the whole houſe, namely, that the height of it to the firſt floore was thirty cubits (according to the reckoning of the booke of <hi>Kings</hi>) and then the chambers over in ſeverall ſtories did riſe to 90 cubits more.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>R. Levi Gerſhom</hi> could well be perſwaded to thinke that the Temple it ſelfe was but 30 cubits high, but are ſomewhat ſwayed by the opinion of ſome of their <hi>Rabbins</hi> which runneth another way. <hi>For from their words it appeareth</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that there were chambers over the Temple and over the Porch:</hi> and this they hold from 1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 28.11.</p>
               <p>The words of that Text are theſe, <hi>David gave to Solomon his ſonne the Patterne of the Porch and the houſes thereof, and the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof, and the upper chambers thereof, and the Parlours thereof and the place of the mercy ſeat:</hi> where all theſe particulars are ſo couched together (except the laſt) as if they were all within the Porch: But the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh of the Porch, as the firſt part in ſight, as you came up, it being the front of all, and the reſt of the parcels mentioned, are to be conceived of not as all crowded in it, but as diſtributed and diſpoſed in other parts of the fabrick, as the Holy Ghoſt relateth and layeth downe elſewhere. And as for the upper chambers here ſpoken of, we need not to confine them ſo, as to ſet them all either over the porch (though there were ſome,) nor over the body of the Temple, but to place them alſo as the Text doth elſewhere, round about the houſe without, in ſeverall ſtories.</p>
               <p>The carefull conſidering the meaſures of the Temple built by the Children of the Captivity, will reaſonably help to put us out of doubt about the matter that we have in diſpute. The meaſures they brought along with them out of <hi>Perſia</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49920:28"/>in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Commiſſion,<note n="[d]" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The foundations to be ſtrongly laid, the height ſixty cubits, and the breadth ſixty cubits, with three rowes of great ſtones and a row of new timber and the expences to be given out of the Kings houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where wee may obſerve,<note n="[e]" place="margin">Aben Ezr. in loc.</note> 1 That the length is not mentioned, becauſe that was to be of the former meaſure. 2 That the breadth, doubled the breadth of <hi>Solomons</hi> build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſide chambers and all taken in. And 3 That the height was double to the height of <hi>Solomons</hi> as it is expreſſed in the booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> and as indeed the height of the Temple was, though the porch were higher. For it ſeemeth utterly againſt reaſon, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould offer to build the houſe as broad again as it was before, and yet not ſo high as it was before by halfe. It is no doubt but <hi>Cyrus</hi> had conſultation with ſome of the Jews about the building, and that either they counſelling him, ſhould adviſe the abatement of ſo much of the height, or he inlarging the breadth and the houſe one way, ſhould cut it ſhort of the height and leſſen it the other way, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding improbable; the length could not be doubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that would have leſſened the meaſure of the Courts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, which might not be indured, but the two other waies of dimenſion which could be allowed, he allowed double to what they were before.</p>
               <p>Therefore the two Texts in <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> are to be taken properly as they there lie before us, namely, that the Porch was 120 cubits high, and that the reſt of the Temple was but 30; and the form of the whole houſe was thus. It ſtood Eaſt and Weſt, the moſt Holy place Weſtward, and the Porch or entrie Eaſtward, and the length of all from Eaſt to Weſt was 70 cubits, the breadth 20 cubits, beſides the breadth of the ſide chambers; The height of the holy and moſt holy place 30 cubits, and the porch ſtood at the Eaſt end like one of our high ſteeples 120 cubits high: And indeed <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple did very truely reſemble one of our Churches, but onely that it differed in this, that the Steeple of it (which was the porch) ſtood at the Eaſt end.</p>
               <p>Now round about the ſides thereof, North and South, and the Weſt end, <hi>Solomon</hi> built chambers of three ſtories high
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49920:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>and five cubits was the height of every ſtory, the whole being 15 cubits high in all, and they joined to the wall of the houſe without. The higheſt ſtory was a cubit wider then the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and the middle a cubit wider then the loweſt, and yet the outmoſt wall of them was even and ſtraight, and jutted not over at one ſtory or other, any whit at all. But the reaſon of this different breadth of the Stories was this, the wall of the Temple for five cubits from the ground upward, was thicker by a cubit then it was from thence above. At the height therefore of thoſe five cubits there was a bench of the wall of a cubit breadth left outerly round about the houſe, on which they laid one end of the beams and timber, which was the roofe of the loweſt roomes, or the floore of the ſecond Story. And then againe for five cubits above that, the wall was thicker by a cubit, then it was above; and at the height of thoſe five cubits there was ſuch another bench left again, and on that they laid the beams for the roofe of the ſecond ſtory, which was the floore of the third. And ſo likewiſe for five cubits above that, the wall was yet thicker by a cubit, then it was above, and there the like bench was left againe, and there were laid the beams of the roofe of the third ſtory and of the whole building.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of that verſe 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.6. <hi>The nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt chamber was five cubits broad, the middlemoſt ſixe cubits broad, and the third was ſeven cubits broad, for he made abatings to the houſe on the outſide round about: that the beames ſhould not have hold of the very walls of the houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus did theſe chambers take up halfe the height of the houſe, being as the lower leads of our Churches to the higher: the uſe of the chambers we ſhall obſerve here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Now above theſe chambers in the wall of the Temple, and in the outer wall of theſe chambers themſelves there were windowes to let in light, which the Text ſaith were <gap reason="foreign">

It was indeed of a 100 cubits high, but not ſo as riſing in an equall ſquare, from the bottome to the top, but riſing ſquare fifty one cubits, as hath been proportioned out: The main foundation 6 cubits high: the wall plaine about it 40 cubits, a carved border above that one cubit; the place for caſting of the raines two cubits; above that the floore laying on one cubit thick, and the plaiſter cover one cubit thick; but then the riſe of the building grew narrower; for from thence it was carryed up ſo towards the middle, as that there were left leads, as one may call them, on the North and South ſides all along, from the Eaſt unto the Weſt: A familiar example of this for the better underſtanding of it we have in the building of exceeding many of our Churches: the pile riſeth of a like breadth to the lower leads, and then it riſeth only in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to the height or roofe of the Church: And ſo was it with the Temple: Goe either to Eaſt or Weſt end, and ſtand in the middle and looke up, and it was 100 cubits, but goe any whit like toward the right or left hand, and it was but half ſo high, for there were the lower leads. <hi>Leads</hi> I cannot but call them, for that language is beſt underſtood amongſt us, though they were not covered with lead (a covering not ſo well known in thoſe times as now) but with a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or parget of a cubit thick, and ſo ſtrongly wrought, and tempered, as that it differed not from the hardneſſe of ſtone.</p>

                  </gap> that we paſſed over even now, but muſt looke back upon it a little, before we leave theſe leads, or this firſt riſing that we are now upon. For the paſſing away of the rains that dropped off this roof, that they ſhould not run down along the wall, and ſo both moulder &amp; deface the ſtones, there was immediately above the imbroidered border that was ſpoken of, a row of ſtones that jutted out of the building more then their fellows, which were neatly and artificially guttered or riggeted, and as artificially jointed together in the guttering (that no rain ſhould drop through) the rigget laid juſt under the edge of the leads, (or ſpouts from the leads) that caſt off the raines, that the droppings falling therein were conveyed away to either end of that ſide on which they were, and ſo ſent

The word is more eaſy to paraphraſe, then <hi>verbatine</hi> to tranſlate. The meaning of the clauſe is this, that whereas there was an hundred Pomegranats in every row; when the pillars were ſet to the wall, four of every row could not be ſeen, but ninety ſix might, the other four being hid behind the pillar as it ſtood cloſe up to the wall: And ſo the Pomegranats were 96 only in ſight.

                  <p>The meaning therefore of the verſe appeareth to be this that at the head of the pillar, even at the ſetting on of the chapiter, there was a curious and a large border or circle of lilly-work, which ſtood out four cubits under the chapiter, &amp; then turned downe, every lilly or long tongue of braſſe, with a neat ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſo ſeemed as a flowred crowne to the head of the pillar, and as a curious garland whereon the chapiter had its ſeat: And that particular expreſſion that it was <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by the Porch,</hi> intendeth to ſhew that theſe long tongues of braſſe which were made like lillies, did not ſuddainly decline, and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And this conſtruction of that verſe, helpeth to cleere and explaine the next verſe that followes after it, which otherwiſe would coſt ſome pains to tranſlate it out of the originall, or to make facil ſenſe of it being tranſlated: In conſonancy and contexture to the verſe before, ſo underſtood as hath been held out, this verſe may be interpreted and paraphraſed thus: <hi>And the chapiters upon the two pillars were alſo above</hi> this lilly work, for they ſate upon the growing out of it, <hi>even from over againſt the belly, which was by the branch-work;</hi> for the lilly-work raught out, as far as the belly of the chapiters raught out, with an accurate bowing or ſwelling upwards towards the belly, where the ſtalkes of the branch-work, and the rowes of the Pomegranats were; even as a lilly gently ſwelleth up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tongue or utmoſt point of it turneth downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The place where theſe pillars ſtood is ſomewhat uncertain; the text indeed ſaith, they ſtood <hi>before the houſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 3.15. and <hi>before the Temple,</hi> ver. 17. but yet it is to ſeek, whether within the porch at the entring in, or without the porch, or within the porch at the Temple dore, which laſt is the opinion of <hi>Robbi Sol.</hi>

And the name of every courſe was written upon their cloſets, and they were all ſhut: And when the men of any courſe came into the ſervice upon the Sabbath, they opened their cloſets, and tooke cut the utenſils: and when they went out of the ſervice, they reſtored their veſtments to their cloſets againe, and ſhut them up. And why made they foure cloſets for every courſe? Namely, that the utenſills might not be jumbled together, but all the breeches were in one cloſet, and upon it was written Breeches; Girdles in another cloſet, and upon it written, Girdles; All the Bonnets in another cloſet, and all the coats in another.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> do ſeeme at the firſt ſight excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to differ, about the meaſure of this gate the<note n="[a]" place="margin">Mid. per. Sect. <hi>1.</hi>

In which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, if we take the proper meaning of either party, the difference between them will not be ſo vaſt, as at the firſt skanning it doth ſeeme to be. It is the manner of the <hi>Talmud</hi> in meaſuring of the gates to ſpeake onely of the open ſpace through which the paſſage was, but <hi>Joſephus,</hi> as hath beene obſerved before, meaſures <gap reason="foreign">

For as to the firſt he ſaith <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>That the gate of the houſe</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this that we are about) <hi>was gilt all over, and ſo was the wall all about it:</hi> And as to the ſecond, he hath this ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what difficult, but well underſtood reſolving the matter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as hath been ſpoken. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>But the Temple having two floores, or being double roofed, that within was lower then that without and had gilded dores of</hi> 55 <hi>cubits high, and</hi> 16 <hi>broad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by what he ſaith that the <hi>Temple was</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>double floored</hi> or roofed, his meaning is, that as you ſtood in the Temple there was a firſt floore over your head, and a roome above that which was called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of which wee have ſpoken before, and above that there was the roofe; Had all the houſe been open to the very roofe as our churches are, there could have been no difference between the height of the holy and moſt holy place to the roofe, but both had beene alike.</p>
                  <p>But both places being floored over, and having an ſupper chamber above them, there was a difference made in the height of this firſt floore: for in the holy place it was five and fifty cubits from the ground, but in the moſt holy place it was but twenty, as ſhall be ſhewed. Now the porch had its floor lay at the leaſt as high if not higher then the floore of the holy place: and ſo the ſpace above the gate to the firſt floore was a goodly ſpace, and made a faire front: It ſeemeth by our Author that the firſt floore of the porch was 90 cubits high, yet doth he reckon the height of the gate but five and fifty, becauſe he reckons only to the height of the floore of the holy place, and the height of the front of the gate of the Oracle, for he ſpeaketh of them both alike.</p>
                  <p>Thus much being obſerved concerning the height and breadth of this gate, it is alſo to be remembred that the wall of the Temple was ſix cubits thick, as was obſerved when we meaſured the breadth of the building.<note n="[c]" place="margin">Mid. ubi ſupra. Ezek. <hi>4.14.</hi>
                     </note> The two leaves of the gate therefore which were five cubits broad apeece, were hung up a little within the thickneſſe of the wall from the porch, ſo that when they were opened they covered the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49920:45"/>whole thickneſſe of the wall on the right hand and the left, that as you paſſed thorough you could not ſee it.</p>
                  <p>Now at the very furtheſt of the thickneſſe of the wall towards the holy place, there was a two leaved doore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe paralleld to this that we have ſurveyed, which when the leaves opened, they fell back to the wall which was at the lower end of the houſe, and covered a place which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilded: for all the walls were guilded but onely the places where the leaves of the doores fell back.</p>
                  <p>And thus had you two ſeverall doors of two folding leaves apeece to go through betweene the porch and the Temple, the one ſtanding within a cubit of the porch, and the other at the very edge of the Wall within, and ſo when they were both ſhut there was a five-cubits ſpace betwixt them, which was ſo much ſpace in the thickneſſe of the Temple wall.</p>
                  <p>The outer door, is called commonly by the Jewes <hi>the great doore of the Temple,</hi> not but that the inner doore was as big, but becauſe of the great front that this gate had, which the other had not: And of this outer doore there are theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials or remarkeable things recorded among them. Firſt that the morning Sacrifice was never killed till this doore was opened: And ſo it is recorded in the Treatiſe <hi>Tamid</hi> or concerning the dayly ſacrifice <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>That he that was to ſlay the Sacrifice, killed him not till he heard the noiſe of the great gate opening.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there they relate that the noiſe of this gate might be heard to <hi>Iericho,</hi> and ſo the noiſe of divers other things there mentioned, in which they do hyperbolize for the glorifying of the matters of the Temple. And a ſecond thing for which this doore is renowned among them, is, for that it had two wickets in it, in either leaſe one, one in the North leafe and another in the South: And that through that in the South no man paſſed, but that that was it of which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith,<note n="[e]" place="margin">Ezek. <hi>44.2.</hi>

                  <p>Being come in he opened that inner doore, and then hee came and opened the outer doore, at the noiſe of the opening of which the killer of the morning Sacriſice went about that worke:<note n="[f]" place="margin">Sotah per. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> In this five cubits ſpace between the two doors even behinde the leafe of the doore on the right hand, there was a marble flag of a cubit ſquare lay looſe in the floor with a ring faſtned in it to pull it up, and when the Prieſts tryed any ſuſpected wife, they came hither and pulled up this ſtone, and tooke duſt from under it, to put into the water to make her drinke as was injoined <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.17. &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>And here two things are to be remembred; 1. that whereas the lower leads of the building which were over the ſide chambers, were but 50 cubits high, as hath beene deſcribed, and there was a paſſage off thoſe leads into the upper cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber over the holy place, and it was by ſteps of ten cubits
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49920:47"/>high, partly without the wall, and partly within the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the wall it ſelfe. a That there was an inequality of the height of the floores in the three parts of the houſe, the porch, the holy place and the moſt holy. The firſt floore of the porch was 90 cubits high, the holy place 60, and the moſt holy but 20. And therefore whereas there was a floore over the moſt holy place, even with the floore over the holy place, <hi>viz.</hi> at 60 cubits height, that was not the firſt floore over it, but there was another floore 40 cubits beneath that.</p>
                  <p>The beauty and richneſſe of this place was exceeding great: The floor of it upon which they trod was planked with firre boards, and they gilt with gold; and the walls were alſo fieled or wainſcoted with cedar, and that gilt likewiſe: This gilding was from the ground floore, even to the floore over head, all the 60 cubits high up the wals; and this is meant when the Text ſaith <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For fifty cubits height of the walls was the imbroidery of branches and open flowers, &amp;c. and for the ten cubits above, it was the place of the windowes: for the ſide chambers without the houſe, in three ſtories, did take up the height of fifty cubits high, ſo that for ſo high no windowes could be made into the houſe, but the ſpace of ten cubits above, was the place for the windowes which were made narrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and broad within.</p>

                  <p>On the top of either row was ſet a golden diſh with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of frankincenſe, which when the bread was taken away, was burnt as incenſe to the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.7. and the bread went to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, or to the Prieſts as their portions to be eaten.</p>
                  <p>What theſe loaves did repreſent and ſignifie, is variouſly gueſſed: the number of twelve in two rowes ſeem to referre to the twelve tribes, whoſe names were ſo divided into ſix and ſix in the two ſtones on the high Prieſts ſhoulders: And as bread is the chief ſubſiſtence and ſtaffe of our mortall life, ſo the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe might denote an acknowledgement of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of their receiving of all their ſubſiſtence from the Lord, to whom they preſented theſe as their tribute: and theſe aſwell as the lamps ſtanding before the Lord, might ſhew, that their ſpirituall and temporall ſupport were both before him.

               <p>There were three which we may call Courts, belonging to the Temple, beſides that ſpace in the mountaine of the houſe without them, which was very large, and which is ordinarily called by Chriſtian writers, <hi>Atrium Gentium,</hi> or <hi>the Court of the Gemiles.</hi> And theſe three were, <hi>The Court of Iſrael and the Prieſts, the Court of the women, and The Chel,</hi>

               <p>Theſe two Courts are ſometimes ſo ſpoken of in ſcripture, as if they were three, for there is mention of the Court of the Prieſts, and the great Court, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 4.9. and the Court of the women, as we ſhall obſerve by and by, and yet they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but two, for though the Court of the Prieſts, and the Court of Iſrael were diſtinguiſhed, yet were they not divided, but the Court of the women was divided from them both.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Courts of the Temple (to the ſurveying of which we are now come) were properly two, <hi>The Court of Iſrael</hi> and <hi>The Court of the Women:</hi> For though there was indeed a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Court of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the Court of the Prieſts, as that the one was not the other, and they that came into the one, might not come into the other, yet was the one ſo within the other, and the partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other ſo ſmall, and but one boundary that incloſed them both, that they were indeed not ſo very properly two Courts, as two ſeverall places for the Prieſts and for the Iſraelites to ſtand in, in one Court: But the Court of Iſrael and the Court of the women were ſo truely and apparently two different Courts, that they lay one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another, and they were parted and divided one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a very high wall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Court of the women</hi> is not mentioned in Scripture by that expreſſe name and title in any place, but yet it is ſpoken of there under two or three other Epithets, or denominations. 1 It is called the <hi>New Court,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.5. where it is ſaid that <hi>Jchoſhaphat ſtood in the congregation of Judah and Jeruſalem in the houſe of the Lord before the new Court:</hi> that is, he and all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſtood in the mountaine of the houſe Eaſtward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Court of the women.</hi> Now <hi>David Kimchi</hi> upon the place though he ſpeake not out ſo much, yet he concludeth indeed that that new Court meaneth the <hi>Court of the Women,</hi> and hee giveth two reaſons why it is called <hi>New:</hi>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>and had appointed that none that were defiled, ſo as they needed to waſh themſelves the ſame day, ſhould come within the Camp of Levi:</hi> which is a peculiar prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition

                  </note> But rather it was called <hi>new,</hi> becauſe it was not made when the other Court was by <hi>Solomon,</hi> but added in aftertime.</p>
               <p>There is mention indeed of the <hi>Inner Court</hi> built by <hi>Solomon</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.36. which inferreth an <hi>outer,</hi> but that <hi>outer</hi> meaneth the whole mountaine of the houſe which lay without the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as is well obſerved by ſome of the Hebrew Doctors, and that is it which is alſo called the great Court, in contradiſtinction to the Court of the Prieſts, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.9. And in that there is mention onely of Solomons building the inner Court, it is an argument that hee built but that Court, and that this that we are ſpeaking of, was not extant in his time, but taken in and built afterward, either by <hi>Aſa</hi> or by <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> before that time and occaſion that the text mentioned in the book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> ſpeaketh of: and ſo there came to bee two <hi>Courts in the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is called <hi>The outer Court, Ezek.</hi> 46.21.<note n="[d]" place="margin">Mid. per. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; Kimch. in loc.</note> as that text is generally and truely underſtood by the Iewiſh writers, which we ſhall have occaſion to examine anon; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the name doth eaſily appeare, namely becauſe it lay on the outſide of the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and further off from the Temple.</p>

               <p>This Court lay at the Eaſt end of the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and was parted from it by a high wall, ſo that whoſoever came
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49920:59"/>to worſhip here, could ſee nothing of the ſervice in the other Court, and indeed heare but little unleſſe they went up the ſteps of the gate and looked in: for til you came to the middle of the entry of the gate that went up into the upper Court, it was but of the ſame holineſſe with the Court of the women, but beyond the middle, it was holier.</p>
               <p>The floore of this Court was even and levell throughout,<note n="[f]" place="margin">Mid. ubi ant.</note> and it was a perfect ſquare of 135 cubits long, and 135. cubits broad; and it was curiouſly flag'd with marble, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was all the ſpace, both Courts, <hi>Chel,</hi> and the other ſpace that was within the wall that incompaſſed the holy ground: And they have this tradition about the pavement of the Court, where the Altar ſtood,<note n="[g]" place="margin">Maym. in beth habbech. per. <hi>1.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The entring into the Court of the women was by three gates, one on the Eaſt, one on the North, and one on the South, and there was a fourth on the Weſt, which went up out of this Court into the upper Court or that of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> All theſe gates as alſo all the other that went into the upper Court (of which hereafter) were<note n="[h]" place="margin">Joſeph. de Bell. ubi ſupr.</note>

                  <hi>Chel,</hi> out of which there were five ſteps that roſe up to the gate to land you in it. The gate it ſelfe was exceeding ſumptuous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding beautifull: and this was that which was called <hi>the beautifull gate of the Temple, Act.</hi> 3.2. at which the Creeple lay begging of almes, both of men and women that went into the Temple; At this gate began <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>The inner Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth often call it, diſtinguiſhing between that ſpace that was incloſed within the boundary wall that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed the whole holy ground, and that ſpace that was incloſed within the wall that incompaſſed the Courts: the former of them was called <hi>the outer Temple,</hi> and the latter was called the <hi>inner,</hi> and both of them bare the name of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and ſo in the Scripture, whoſoever went but within the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49920:60"/>compaſſe of the holy ground, is ſaid to have gone into the Temple.</p>
               <p>Now this gate being the very front and entrance into the Inner Temple, or into that ſpace within which the choiceſt ſanctity and bravery of the Temple was, it was built and decked with ſuch ſumptuouſneſſe and ſingular gallantry, as was fitting for the frontiſpice of ſo brave a place: And hence it came to beare the name of <hi>beautifull,</hi> and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, in compariſon of the gate <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> or the outmoſt Eaſt gate that entered into the mountaine of the houſe, for that was but a low and homely gate-houſe, for a reaſon that hath been obſerved heretofore: but this was goodly and lofty, and ſtood bravely mounted upon the far higher ground.</p>
               <p>This gate <hi>Joſephus</hi>
                  <note n="[i]" place="margin">Joſeph. ubi ſupr.</note> calleth <hi>the Corinthian gate,</hi> becauſe it was of Corinthian braſs, whereas the reſt of the gates were gilt with gold. And here occurreth a difference betwixt him and the Talmudicall writers; for they do unanimouſly hold the brazen gate to be the gate of <hi>Nicanor</hi> (which wee ſhall ſurvey anon) which was the gate that went out of the Court of the Women into the Court of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> but he doth as confidently affirme on the other hand, that it was that that went out of the <hi>Chel</hi> into the Court of the women. His words are theſe Mia <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>There was one gate without the Temple of Corinthian braſſe, which exceeded in glory thoſe of gold or ſilver:</hi> Now where this gate ſtood, namely, in that place that we are upon, appeareth by this paſſage of his a little after. <hi>The gate above the Corinthian gate which opened Eaſt, over againſt the gate of the Temple, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not much materiall to determine whether of theſe Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne gates were of braſſe, it is onely needfull to be reſolved which of them was that that was called the gate of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> (becauſe upon the knowledge of that there are divers things depending, and in the next chapter but one, ſhall be ſhewed that it was that gate that went out of the Court of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into the Court of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>) But if I were to moderate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the differing parties, I ſhould ſay their difference in this matter is not reall, but onely apparent: <hi>Joſephus</hi> calls the gate that came into the Court of the Women, <hi>the brazen
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49920:60"/>gate,</hi> becauſe it was all ſo, poſts and lintell and all overlaid with braſſe, which ſhone above gold: but the Talmudiſts ſay, the doores of the <hi>gate of Nicanor</hi> were only of braſſe, but the whole front of the gate beſide, all of gold: and ſo that was not the brazen gate, but onely brazen doores, but the other was properly the <hi>brazen gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> had healed the Creeple at this gate, the text ſaith, that <hi>he went with them into the Temple,</hi> that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court of the Women, which was the common and ordinary place of worſhip for thoſe that brought not a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and from thence he went backe againe with them through this gate into <hi>Solomons porch</hi> or the Eaſterne cloiſter of the Mountaine of the houſe, and there they preach and convert five thouſand. And now let us go up through this gate into the Court, and ſurvey it it ſelfe.</p>

All which, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49920:62"/>what is ſaid moreover, that <hi>they were not roefed over,</hi> may very well conſiſt together. For grant every one of theſe ſpaces to bee built within with chambers round about: there might bee very fair chambers and yet a good handſome open Court in the middle: At either end chambers of 10 cubits broad, &amp; yet an open ſpace of 20 cubits between: And on either ſide chambers of ſeven or eight cubbits broad: and yet an open ſpace of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſixteen cubits between: Thus therefore doth the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe places ſeeme to bee; that there were fair chambers round about which were roofed over as other buildings, and in the middle was an open court, round about which were boyling ranges, whoſe chimneys went up in the inner walls of the chambers or the walls to the open place: And ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This Court of the women was the place, where both men and women, did ordinarily worſhip, that either came to pray at other times then the houres of prayer, or that at the houres of prayer came and brought no Sacrifice with them.

               <p>And ſo the market that was in the Temple of ſheep and oxen it is like it was not conſtantly there, but for ſuch times of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, when the multitude of people and Sacrifices was ſo exceeding great, though indeed there was merchandizing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things there, all the year long in the <hi>Tabernz.</hi> or <hi>ſhpps.</hi> that we have ſpoken of before. The place where the marketing of the ſheep and oxen was, was the great ſpace of the mountaine of the houſe, that lay upon the South fide of the Courts, for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49920:65"/>on the Weſt and North ſides the roome was too ſtrait for ſuch a matter, and on the Eaſt ſide was the moſt common entrance of the people, and ſo theſe cattel would have ſtopt up the way: but on the South there was a place exceeding roomy and ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and it they had taken up for a market at ſuch times, making the houſe of God an houſe of Merchandiſe.</p>
               <p>Amongſt thoſe Authors that ſpeake of theſe two half-ſhekel cheſts, I find not any that doth inform us, where they ſtood, or where theſe Collectors of the poll-money did fit in the Temple to receive it: nor indeed is it of any great import to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after it, ſince their ſitting there was but for a ſhort ſpace, as a moneth or ſuch a matter, and ſo they had done: It is moſt probable they ſate about the Eaſt gate <hi>Shuſhan</hi> as being the chiefeſt and commoneſt entrance.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe two treaſure-cheſts that were in uſe but for a certain time every year, there were eleven more that were of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and continuall uſe, and that ſtood in their places all the year long, and upon every one of them was written what uſe and imployment they were put unto.</p>

               <p>Theſe many cheſts ſtood continually in the Temple, with every one its title written upon it, that told its uſe, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever would offer any one of theſe things mentioned, he could readily goe by thoſe directions, where to put the money of his offering: And theſe are thoſe <hi>Gazophylacia or Treaſuries</hi> that <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith <hi>the eloiſters were before;</hi> that is, whereas the Courts were cloiſtered round about, and thoſe cloiſters were, on the ſide toward the Court, ſupported with pillars, theſe cheſts were ſet in the Court before thoſe pillars: as if ſuch cheſts ſhould be ſet in the quadrangle before the pillars that beare up the cloiſter walkes in the Royall Exchange <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in whether of the Courts were theſe cheſts diſpoſed of, in the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the Court of the women, or in both, ſome in the one and ſome in the other?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe conſiderations doe evince, that they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Court of the women: 1. Becauſe thither was the acceſſe freer then it was into the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and it is no doubt, theſe cheſts would be ſet in a place moſt commodious for every one to come unto them: women might not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other Court at all, nor men neither, ſo ordinarily as they might into this, and theſe treaſuries in all reaſon were to be ſet, where men and women did both reſort. 2. In the upper Court, if theſe cheſts ſtood before or on the outſide of the Cloiſter, they ſtood in the Court of the Prieſts, and thither might not an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that was come into the upper Court, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unleſſe it were upon three ſingular occaſions when he had a ſacrifice, which we have mentioned elſewhere, and putting money into the treaſuries was none of them. 3. It is ſaid in <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.41. That <hi>Jeſus ſate over againſt the Treaſury and ſaw the people cast in money, and be ſaw a widow throw in two mites:</hi> Now into the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> this widow might not come, and in that Court <hi>Chriſt</hi> might not fit, for they had a tradition, that <hi>none might ſit in that Court, but onely the Kings of the houſe of David:</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:49920:66"/>But the meaning of the place is, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> fitting in the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Court of the women, ſaw the people caſt money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe cheſts, according as they were minded to offer for this or that occaſion: and there came a poore widow and threw in <hi>two mites which make a farthing.</hi> It is the ordinary expreſſion that the Hebrew authors uſe to ſignifie the peoples giving to the treaſury by, to ſay <gap reason="foreign">

The chamber of the Veſſells was, where any that willingly offered any veſſell, caſt it in there: and once in thirty dayes the treaſurers opened the chamber, and fetched out what they found fit for the ſupply of the Temple, and what was not of it ſelfe fit, they ſold and turned into ſome thing that was fit, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And now let us looke over this Court that we have been ſo long about, at one view: As you were entered into it at the Eaſt gate, you ſaw in every corner of it, a piece of building that had a quadrangle in the midſt of it: on the North and the South ſides there was a gate juſt in the middle betweene theſe buildings: and from the buildings on either ſide, there ran a cloiſter ſupported with goodly marble pillars unto the gates: &amp; the like cloiſter there was at the Eaſt quatter at which you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: Theſe cloiſters had beaches within them for the people to ſit downe when they thought good, as there were in the cloiſters that ran along the outmoſt wall that encompaſſed the mountaine of the houſe: Before theſe cloiſters on the Eaſt, North, and South ſides, ſtood the treaſure cheſts, and then you
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49920:67"/>were come into the open Court. Before you as you went up toward the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was a goodly riſing of ſteps up to the gate of that Court, called the gate of <hi>Nicanor</hi> which we are now to ſurvey the next: and upon this quarter there was no cloiſter at all.</p>

He is mentioned in the firſt and ſecond chapters of Middeth, as that there is a gate in the Court on the Eaſt, which is the gate of Nicanor, and that it had two wickets, one on the right hand, and another on the left. And ſo it is ſaid in the</hi> 6. <hi>Chapter of Shekalim, and that is ſet over againſt the moſt holy place which was weſtward where the divine Glory dwelt: And therefore in the end of the treatiſe Beraceth, it ſaith, Let not a man uſe irreverence before this gate of Nicanor, or the Eaſt gate: And ſo in the firſt chapter of Sotah.

This Nicanor was one of the Chaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim, and be went to Alexandria in Aegypt, and made there two bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen doores with much curioſity: intending to ſet them up in the Court of the Temple, and be brought them away by ſea: Now a great ſtorme happening, the mariners caſt one of the doores over board to lighten the ſhip: and intended alſo to throw over the other alſo. Which when Nicanor perceived, he bound himſelfe to the doore with cords, and told them, that if they threw that in, they ſhould threw him in too: And ſo the ſea ceaſed from her rage: And when he was landed at Ptolemais, and bemoaned the loſſe of his other doore, and prayed to God about it, the ſea caſt up the doore, in that place where the holy man had landed. But ſome ſay a great fiſh caſt it up: And this was the miracle that was done about his doors, and they ſet them up on the Eaſt ſide of the Court, before the Temple. But in the booke of Ioſeph ben Gorion, be ſaith, That the gate of Nicanor was ſo called, becauſe a wonder was done there, for there they flew Nicanor a prince of the Grecians in the time of the Aſmoneans, and ſo it ſeemeth in the latter end of the ſecond chapter of the treatiſe Taanith.</hi> Thus <hi>Iuchaſin.</hi>

               <p>The two courſes of the Prieſts and Levites now preſent,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49920:70"/>namely that courſe that came in on the Sabbath, and the other that had ſerved their weeke and were now going out, <hi>Jeboiada</hi> divides either of them into three parts, into ſix in all. They that came in on the Sabbath were to be: 1. A third part of them for the Altar and ſervice, the Prieſts for the ſacrifices, and the Levites for ſingers and porters as in the conſtant duty and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. For it was now the Sabbath day, and had it beene any other day, it is not to be imagined, that <hi>Jebo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ada</hi> would neglect the affaires of God though he went about the affaires of the King: But he provides for both, ſo that the Temple ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may have its due attendance, as well as the Kings corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 5. of 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be rendred thus, <hi>A third part of you ſhall be thoſe that come in on the Sabbath:</hi> that is, a third part of you ſhall be as thoſe that come in on the Sabbath to attend the ſervice as at other times. And ſo is 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.4. to be tranſlated, <hi>A third part of you ſhall be thoſe that come in on the Sabbath, for Prieſts, and Levites, and Porters:</hi> that is, to attend the Altar, ſong and gates as in the conſtant ſervice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another third part, for keepers of the watch at the Kings houſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And another third part at <hi>the gate Sur</hi> which is alſo called <hi>the gate of the foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the tents in the two bookes laid together doe plainly diſtribute the courſe that was to come in on the Sabbath, as he will ſee that will carefully compare them together in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</p>
               <p>The courſe that was going out on the Sabbath was diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, 1. One third part of them to the gate behinde the guard, 2. Two third parts to keepe the watch of the houſe of the Lord for the ſafety of the Kings.</p>
               <p>Now the very diſpoſall of theſe guards will help us to judge concerning the gates that we have in mention, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve us that they were not any gates of the Temple at all, but that they ſtood in ſome place elſe. For the gates of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were guarded by the Porters of the courſe that came in as in the ordinary manner: and there was an extraordinary guard added beſides throughout all the mountaine of the houſe, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49920:71"/>in the Court, of that courſe that was going out, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.7, 8.11. Therefore <hi>the gate Sur</hi> or <hi>the gate of the foundation,</hi> which was guarded by a third part of thoſe that come in on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, cannot be ſuppoſed for any gate of the Temple, ſince the Temple was guarded by two parts of thoſe that went out. So that were I to deſcribe the city as I am now about deſcribing the Temple, I ſhould place <hi>the gate Sur</hi> ſomewhere in <hi>Sion,</hi> and there alſo ſhould I place <hi>the gate behinde the guard:</hi> and it would not be very hard to gather up faire probability of their ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there. Now though ſo ſtrong guards were ſet both in the Temple and in <hi>Zion,</hi> yet <hi>Athaliah</hi> for whom all this adoe is made, comes up into the Temple, ſo far as to ſee the young King at his pillar in the Court before the Eaſt gate, and no man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts her, partly becauſe ſhe was Queene, partly becauſe ſhe came alone, and chiefly becauſe they knew not <hi>Jehoiadas</hi> minde concerning her. But when he bids <hi>have her out of the ranges,</hi> they laid hold upon her, and ſpared her till ſhe was downe the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey <hi>Shalletheth,</hi> and then they ſlew her.</p>
               <p>If by <hi>the ranges,</hi> the rankes of men that ſtood round about the mountaine of the houſe, be not to be underſtood, I ſhould then thinke they meane either the ranks of trees that grew on either ſide that cauſey, or the railes that were ſet on either ſide it for the ſtay and ſafety of thoſe that paſſed upon it.

                  <p>This is the gate of which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaketh, chap. 46.1, 2. <hi>The gate of the inner Court that looketh toward the Eaſt, ſhall bee ſhut for the ſix working dayes: but on the Sabbath it ſhall be opened, and in the day of the New Moon it ſhall bee opened: And the Prince ſhall come by the way of the porch of that gate without, and ſhall ſtand by the poſt of the Gate, &amp;c.</hi> Before this gate within had <hi>Solomon</hi> pitched his brazen Scaffold, on which he kneeled &amp; prayed at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the houſe. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 6.13. compared with 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.22. and in after times the Kings entring in at this gate had their ſtation within it, as he had given them example, and there ſtood the Kings pillar as it is called, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.13. that is, his ſeat was ſet within this gate in the Court by one of the pillars that bare up the Cloiſter: For as this Eaſt quarter of the Court was the moſt proper place for the people to worſhip in, ſo moſt eſpecially in that place of it which did moſt directly face the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49920:73"/>doore of the Temple and the Altar before it, and that was in the very entrance up from the gate it ſelf, and here was the King ſeated by one of the pillars. Something according to this diſpoſall of the King in his place in the Court doth <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeak, though in his deſcription there is ſome kinde of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for myſtery ſake. You may obſerve in him, that the Eaſt gate of the outer Sanctuary was contiuually ſhat, and the Eaſt gate of the inner was ſhut all the ſix dayes of the weeke, which were not indeed ſo in the common uſe of the Temple as it ſtood, for both the gates were dayly opened, but hee hath ſo charactered them for the higher magnifying of that glory which he ſaith was now entred into the Temple: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed the King in his worſhipping did go within the Court, or within the gate and there worſhip, and there fit downe in the time of Divine Service, hee hath brought in the Prince but to the poſts of the gate and there ſtanding whileſt his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was offering: By his deſcription every one that came up to this gate, muſt either enter at the North gate or South gate of the Court of the women, becauſe the Eaſt gate was ſhut, chap. 44.1. and hereupon is that injunction, that <hi>when the people of the land come before the Lord in the Solemn Feaſts, hee that entereth in by the way of the North-gate to worſhip, muſt go out by the way of the South gate, and hee that entreth by the way of the South gate, muſt goe forth by the way of the North gate: he muſt not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in.</hi> Ch. 46.9. Whereas in the common acceſſe to the Temple as it ſtood either before or after the captivity, the Eaſt gate of the Court of the women was conſtantly open and their moſt ordinary coming in was at that gate, &amp; ſo they went up through the Court of the women to the gate of <hi>Nica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> yea and oftentimes within it into the Court: Yet did they imitate and follow this preſcript of the Prophet, under the ſecond Temple, in not returning and going out at the ſame gate at which they had come in; The Talmudiſts have this Tradition about this matter. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>So that the common and ordinary way of coming into the Temple to worſhip, was to come in at the Eaſt gate of the Court of the women, and up to the gate of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> and there to worſhip and ſo back again, and out at the North or South doore of that Court: The Phariſee in the parable went up to this gate as farre as hee could goe, becauſe hee would put his ſeeming devotion to the fartheſt, but the poor Publican ſtood a far off. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. Even the King himſelf though hee came in on the Weſt quarter of the mountain of the houſe, yet came hee down hither to goe into the Court of the women, and ſo up through the Eaſt gate of the Court, to his ſeate which was before that gate. The ſtationary men, of whom wee have ſpoken in due place, they went within the gate into the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo did other Iſraelites at the ſolemn feſtivials when there were abundance of Sacrifices, eſpecially at the Paſſeover, and hee that brought a ſingle Sacrifice, went into the Court at one of the North gates of it, of which wee ſhall ſpeak when its courſe comes: but ordinarily a man that came into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pray or to worſhip, and brought not a Sacrifice, hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped before the gate of <hi>Nicanor</hi> which faced the gate of the Temple, and ſo returned.</p>

That <hi>the water gate and the draw-well-roome</hi> doe ſeem by their very names to refer one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as that it is not proper to part them, and howſoever there was ſomething elſe in the reaſon of the name of <hi>the water-gates,</hi> beſides its ſtanding ſo neer the draw-well, yet ſhall wee obſerve hereafter that this might bee alſo one reaſon of the name of it, and that thoſe two did indeed ſtand joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. 2. The <hi>Talmud</hi> ſaith the roofes of theſe three peeces of building were even (<hi>Mid. per.</hi> 5.) by which it ſeemeth that they ſtood not at diſtance one from another but conjoyning, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that a gate interpoſed between them 3.

                  <hi>The place of the comming downe of the water</hi> on the South ſide of the Temple, which hath been ſhewed in its due place not capable of any conſtruction ſo proper as this, that the pipes from <hi>Etam</hi> came downe along there.</p>
               <p>The waters then from that fountaine <hi>Etam</hi> being gathered into this well or great ciſterne, were from hence diſperſed into the ſeverall offices and places where water was neceſſary (as the new river from the water houſe into <hi>London</hi>) a wheele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed to raiſe it and force it up into the pipes or conveyances that were to carry it into the ſeverall receptacles and uſes: For in ſome places there were bathes on the very top of the gates and buildings, as we ſhall obſerve as we goe along, and to keepe them full and in a continuall ſupply of water, was required, ſome inforcing of the water up, which was done by the uſe and activity of this wheele.</p>
               <p>Now over this well there was a faire building, ſutable to the reſt of the buildings about the Court, and it had a doore into the Court, that the prieſts might readily and without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, ſtep out of the Court into it, when they had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to fetch up water for any uſe.

                  <hi>That a ſacrifice of thanksgiving, the Nazarites ram, the ordinary peace-offerings, the Firſtlings, tithe, and Paſſeover were ſlaine in any part of the Court:</hi> where by any part of the Court, it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the South ſide, in oppoſition to the North of which it had ſpoken before, and it meaneth the South ſide in ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as not onely juſt over againſt the Altar, but in a larger extent, as we ſhall ſhew more fully when we come
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49920:88"/>to ſurvey the ſides of the Court it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Firſtlings then being to be ſlaine on this South ſide of the Court, on which we are ſurveying the gates and buildings, they were brought in at this gate which we are upon, and from thence it tooke the name of <hi>the gate of the Firſtlings.</hi> The water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate indeed was nearer the Altar, and a more direct way to it, but to have killed the beaſts thereabout would have hindred the paſſage to the Altar, from the <hi>Draw-well, Water-gate</hi> and <hi>wood-roome,</hi> unto which places there was very frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from the Altar, and therefore the Firſtlings and other Sacrifices that were to be ſlaine on the South ſide of the Court, were brought in at the gate above, as more out of the way, and ſlaine thereabout as in a place of leſſe interruption. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the tradition mentioned, doth allot the South ſide of the Court for the proper place of ſlaying thoſe particular ſacrifices that it nameth, yet doth it ſpeak it in this latitude <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>That their killing might be in any part of the Court:</hi> becauſe that though ordinarily and regularly they were to be ſlaine on the South ſide of the Court, yet if they were nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and could not conveniently be ſlaughtered in that place, they might be ſlaine on the other ſide, as the Paſſeover were killed on both the ſides, becauſe of their number: whereas the ſacrifices that were to be ſlaine on the North ſide muſt be ſlaine there, and there was no diſpenſation to remove them thence.</p>
               <p>The preſenting of the Firſtlings at the gate that we are about, may put us in remembrance of preſenting the firſt borne; All the males of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to appeare before the Lord thrice every yeare, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. now this command did not take in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (as their tradition did interpret it)<note n="[n]" place="margin">Id. in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giga per. <hi>1.</hi>

The place where they were preſented, was in the gate of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> for that was both the moſt peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar place of appearing before the Lord, and there women that

                  </note> They hold that it was called <hi>the gate of kindling</hi> or <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> becauſe through it wood was brought to the Altar to keepe the fire continually burning according to the law <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.12. But why this way? ſince they might have gone a nearer way to the Altar by far, either through the water-gate or the gate of the Firſtlings, ſeeing the <hi>Wood-roome</hi> was betweene them two, as hatg been ſhewed: and it is probable enough that the wood out of the wood-roome was not brought through any of the Court gates at all to the Altar, but out at a doore which went out of the roome it ſelfe in to the Court.</p>
               <p>To find out therefore a reaſon of the name, I cannot but look over to the other ſide of the Court, from this gate that we are about, to that gate there, that was over againſt it, and there I obſerve the gate to be called <hi>Beth Mokadh,</hi> or <hi>the Gate of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire,</hi> as well as this is called <hi>the Gate of kindling.</hi> And the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49920:89"/>reaſon of that name was, becauſe a fire was kept there conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for the ſenior prieſts, as ſhall be ſhewed anon, and ſo it may be well conjectured, a fire was kept here for the Levites: And though I finde not mention either in the <hi>Talmud</hi> or <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> of any building that joined to this gate, yet ſince there is mention in the treatiſe <hi>Middoth</hi> of the Levites keeping a guard, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>In the chamber of the vaile,</hi> I finde not where to allot that place better then to this gate we are about: For when it ſpeaketh of <hi>the chamber of the vaile,</hi> it meaneth not either any chamber joyning to the body of the Temple it ſelfe, nor any chamber in the Court (for the Levites kept not their guards within the Court but without) but ſome chamber with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Court, which was over againſt the place of the vaile, which divided betwixt the holy and moſt holy place. And as there was a long building that ran along from that oppoſite north gate up toward the weſt to the very corner of the wall of the Court that way: ſo from this gate weſtward there ran a long building to the corner of the Court on this ſide, in which large peece of building having partitions within, there were two guards of Levites almoſt joyning together: So there were three of thoſe guards very neare together: one joyning to the gate on the Eaſt ſide,<note n="[c]" place="margin">Ibid.</note> (for at five of the gates of the Court the Levites guarded, and this was one of the five) another joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the gate on the Weſt ſide, which was called the guard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt the vaile, and the third at the corner of the Court: Now as there was a common fire kept for the Prieſts on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Court, in a large building oppoſite to this, from whence the gate joyning to it tooke the name: ſo is it very likely, there was a common fire kept for the Levites which gave this gate the denomination of <hi>the gate of kindling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we ſurveyed the gates and buildings on the ſouth ſide of the Court, their orderthus, comming up from the Eaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Weſt: Firſt the room <hi>Gazith</hi> at the Southweſt corner: then the roome of the <hi>Draw-well:</hi> joyning to that the <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and over that the roome <hi>Abhtines:</hi> Joyning to that gate on the other ſide, the <hi>Wood-roome,</hi> and over that the Councell chamber: then <hi>the Gate of the Firſtlings,</hi> with a Levites ward joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to it on one ſide: then the <hi>Gate of kindling</hi> and a Levites
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49920:89"/>ward on either ſide it, and that building on the Weſt ſide of it running up to the Weſt corner of the Court. Now <hi>Aha Joſe</hi> a ſpokes man in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> nameth yet one gate more, and more Weſt then theſe that we have named, on this ſame ſide which he calleth <hi>the upper gate,</hi> and over againſt it on the North ſide he nameth a gate more then the common account and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <hi>the gate of Jechoniah:</hi> But he goeth alone in his opinion as to the number of the Gates of the Court: yet thus farre doe other of his nation goe with him, that they ſay there were three gates on the North ſide of the Court, and that there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them, a paſſage through <hi>Beth Mokadh</hi> large building out of the <hi>chel</hi> into the Court, which I ſuppoſe is that which he calleth the gate of <hi>Jechoniah:</hi> and the reaſon of the name is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe <hi>Jechoniah</hi> went out at that gate into his captivity: And ſo it may be that in this large building on this ſide which ran betweene the <hi>Gate of kindling</hi> and the Weſt corner, there was a paſſage thorough, which he ſtiles with the title of <hi>the upper gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But howſoever it was in his account in the ſecond Temple, the very title of <hi>the upper gate</hi> may not undeſervedly call upon us, to looke after that which is called <hi>the upper gate of Benjamits in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> in the times of the firſt Temple <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 2. It is ſaid there that <hi>Paſhur ſmote Jeremy and put him in the ſtocks that were in the high gate</hi> or upper gate <hi>of Benjamin, which was in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> hath made it ſhie to render is <hi>in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> it may be becauſe they thought it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to have a paire of ſtocks in the Temple: and therefore they have tranſlated it <hi>which was by the houſe of the Lord,</hi> as reputing it not a gate of the Temple but ſome other: but the words in the originallare ſo plaine, and the conſent of tranſlaters ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous that it meaneth <hi>in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> that to ſwarve from it were but to ſtraine a plaine and a facile text, and to obſcure a place which is not obſcure of it ſelfe. The mountaine of the Temple lay in the lot of the tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> as hath been obſerved before, &amp; the line that divided between the lots came along at the Southeaſt corner of the Altar as we ſhall obſerve anon, ſo that the Temple and Altar were in the tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> according to <hi>Moſes</hi> prophecy that God ſhould dwell
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49920:90"/>between <hi>Benjamins</hi> ſhoulders, and ſo was the South wall of the Court till you came downe over againſt that point of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and then came in the lot of <hi>Judah.</hi> It appeareth therefore that there were but two gates on this ſide of the Court in the times of the firſt Temple, and they were called <hi>the upper</hi> and the <hi>lower gate of Benjamin,</hi> becauſe they ſtood in his lot: And there were two gates on the North ſide of the Court, and they were called, <hi>The gate of the Altar, which was Northward,</hi> and <hi>the gate of the Lords houſe which was Northward,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew by and by.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now come to the North ſide of the Court, where before we fall to ſurveying of the gates and buildings, that were there, in the times of the ſecond Temple, it will not be amiſſe to looke what we finde there in the times of the firſt in that paſſage of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> chap. 8. ver. 3.5.14. <hi>He brought me in the viſions of God to Jeruſalem to the doore of the inner Court gate that looketh toward the North, where was the ſeat of the image of jealonſie which provoketh to jealouſie. And he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Sonne of man lift up now thine eyes the way towards the North: ſo I lift up mine eyes the way towards the North, and behold North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the gate of the Altar this image of jealouſie in the entry. And he brought me to the doore of the gate of the Lords houſe which was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, and behold, there ſate women weeping for Tammuz:</hi> Here are two gates ſpecified on the North ſide of the Court and they are called <hi>the gate of the Altar</hi> and <hi>the gate of the Lords houſe towards the North:</hi> becauſe the one was over againſt the Altar, and the other over againſt the body of the Temple. To that over againſt the Altar is the prophet firſt brought in his viſion, and there he ſeeth <hi>the image of jealouſie:</hi> not in this gate of the Altar, but in the mountaine of the houſe Northward of this gate, and of the prophet as he ſtood in it. For the prophet is not brought within the Court at this gate, but is ſet without it, and there he is bidden to looke Northward, and there he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49920:91"/>ſeeth that image. This was not any picture or image to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent jealouſie by, but it is called <hi>the image of jealouſie,</hi> becauſe it provoked the jealous God to jealouſie, it being ſet even in his Sanctuary and before his Altar: what Idol this was is but loſt labour to goe about to determine: I ſhould aſſoone conjecture <hi>Molech</hi> as any other, becauſe that was the higheſt idolatry and moſt provoking, namely their burning of their children in the fire, and becauſe they were exceeding taxable and taxed for this Idolatry. Whether there were this Idol in the Temple at this very inſtant when <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had the viſion, which was in the ſixth yeare of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> or whether the viſion repreſent to him the Idolatry that had been in the Temple at any time, is not much eaſier to determine neither, but be the Idol what it would, and meane he the time when he will, it was no ſmall abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation when an Idolatrous chappel or manſion is erected in the mountaine of the Lords houſe, even facing the very gate that opened upon the Altar. This gate was the lower North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate which in the times of the ſecond Temple was called the Gate <hi>Nitſots</hi> or <hi>of the Song.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the prophet is brought to the upper North gate, the text ſaith he was brought to <hi>the doore of the Court,</hi> ver. 7. that is, to the Eaſt gate which was the commoneſt way of entrance, and in that gate the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> uſed to ſit in thoſe times, and there he ſeeth their Councell-chamber painted all about with ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and the 70 members of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> themſelves offering Idolatrous incenſe: Then is he brought to the upper North gate, which opened upon the body of the Temple, and there he ſeeth women weeping for <hi>Tammuz:</hi> what <hi>Tammuz</hi> was, or what their weeping meant, it is not to our ſubject to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here: I will onely leave the gloſſe of <hi>David Kimchi</hi> upon this matter with the reader, and trouble him with no more diſcourſe about it. <hi>Some interpret it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they kept a feaſt to the Idol in the beginning of the moneth Tammuz: others inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the word Tammuz to ſignifie burnt from</hi>

                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.19. <hi>meaning that they wept for him that was burnt, becauſe they burnt their ſons and daughters in the fire. Others, that they had a trick to convey water into the Idols eyes which was called Tammuz, ſo that he ſeemed to weep and to beſeech them that they would ſerve him.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49920:91"/>But our great wiſe man Rabbi Moſes bar Maiemon writes that it is found in the bookes of the ancient, that there was a man of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous prophets whoſe name was Tammuz, and he called to a certaine King and commanded him to worſhip the ſeven planets and the twelve ſignes, and the King ſlew him: And on the night of his death, all the Idols from all parts of the earth were gathered into the Temple at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, to the golden image which was the image of the Sun, which image hung betweene heaven and earth, and it fell into the midſt of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and all the images about it: It told them what hath happened to Tammuz the prophet, and all the Idols wept and lamented all that night, and when it was morning they flew to their owne homes: So this became a cuſtome to them on the firſt day of the month Tammuz every yeare, to bewaile and lament Tammuz. But ſome interpret Tammuz to be the name of a beaſt which they worſhipped.</hi>

               <p>Thus may we ſuppoſe upon this text of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that in the Temple before the captivity there were but two gates on the Northſide of the Court, or at leaſt there is not mention of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more: but in the ſecond Temple there were three: The names of them going from Weſt to Eaſt were theſe. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Beth Mokadh,</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Talmud</hi>) <hi>was a great arched roome, and it was ſet about with ſtone benches: on which the Elders of the houſe of their fathers ſlept, and the keyes of the Court were in their keeping: But the young men of the Prieſt-hood ſlept in their garments on the ground: they ſlept not in the holy garments, but put thoſe off, folded them up and laid them under their heads, and lay in their owne wearing clothes:</hi> So that this roome was both a thorough paſſe, and a great hall where was kept a common and a conſtant fire: and the gates on either ſide of the arch being ſhut, it was as a cloſe roome, and as if it had not beene a thorough paſſage at all.</p>
               <p n="5">5 In this roome there was a box or cabinet as we may call it, in which were laid up the keyes of the Court, and taken out and in, as the doores were locked or to be unlocked.

Therefore it is hard to tell which way this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the bathing place lay, ſince the word will inlarge it to any part of the Temple. It appeareth that it was ſome vault under ground through which they paſſed; into which vault they went downe by a turning paire of ſtaires, out of the Northweſt roome of <hi>Beth Mokadh.</hi> And from thence whither they went, whether under the <hi>Chel</hi> as <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> conceiveth, or under ſome part of the Court, or mountaine of the houſe, it is but in vaine to ſearch: It ſeemeth the <hi>Bath</hi> was under ground, and a roome by it with a fire in it to warme themſelves at when they had done bathing.</p>

For although it was not lawfull for women to goe ordinarily into the Court as it was for men, but they were confined to their owne Court, yet as I have obſerved elſewhere out of <hi>Toſaphta,</hi> women when they brought ſacrifices might and did goe into the Court of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as well as men. It is true indeed that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>women after childbirth</hi> appeared in the gate of <hi>Nicanor</hi> for the making of their atonement, and came but up into the gate and not into the Court at all, becauſe they came thither for their full purification: but thoſe women that were clean, and came not upon any occaſion of purification, but brought burnt-offerings or ſin or treſpaſſe-offerings, they preſented them and themſelves with them at this gate. There was a gate was nearer to the Altar then this, namely the Gate <hi>Nitſots,</hi> which we are to ſurvey by and by, but the place of the rings or ſlaughter place being between it and the Altar, it was not a place of that clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and uninterrupted acceſſe that this was of,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49920:94"/>and therefore the ſacrifices both of men and women were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented here. Yet did the gate beare the name of the women rather then of the men, as from the rarer matter of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens going into the Court, which was more commonly done by men.</p>
               <p>And this helpes us to one reaſon why this gate was called <hi>the Gate of Corban,</hi> or of <hi>the offering,</hi> namely becauſe the ſacrifices to be offered up were brought up in this way. And this very reaſon <hi>Bartenora</hi> giveth ſaying <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Here they brought in the moſt holy Sacrifices, which were to be ſlaine on the North ſide of the Altar.</hi> Over againſt this Gate on the other ſide of the Court there was a gate that bare two names as well as this. It was called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>The gate of offering,</hi> becauſe the ſacrifices that were to be ſlaine on the South ſide of the Altar were brought in at that gate and it was called alſo <hi>the gate of Firſtlings,</hi> becauſe thoſe were the chiefeſt of thoſe offerings. So alſo this gate where we are: it was called <hi>the gate of Corban</hi> or <hi>of offering,</hi> becauſe the Sacrifices to be ſlaine on the North ſide of the Altar were brought in by it: and it was called alſo <hi>the gate of the women,</hi> becauſe their paſſage through it with their ſacrifices was more rare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable then mens.<note n="[b]" place="margin">Zevachin per. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> Now theſe were the ſacrifices that were ſlaine on this North ſide of the Altar: <hi>The moſt holy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the hullock and goat of the day of Expiation, the hullocks and goats that were burnt, all ſin-offerings, whole-burnt-offerings and treſpaſſe-offerings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Onely the lambes of the daily ſacrifice, though they were ſlaine on the North ſide of the Altar, yet is it like they were not brought into the Court at this gate, but at that that joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Beth Mokadh,</hi> for in that piece of building the <hi>Lamb-room</hi> was where they were kept as hath been ſhewed. And ſo we have one reaſon why theſe two gates bare the name of <hi>Corban.</hi> The upper was ſo called becauſe the daily ſacrifice or <hi>Corban</hi> was brought through it, and the lower, becauſe other ſacrifices were brought through that.</p>
               <p>But there was ſomething more in the name beſides: As there were ſeverall treaſure cheſts in the Temple, which have been named, and ſeverall treaſuries in the gate-houſes of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49920:95"/>of the Temple, and in the chambers that joyned to the Temple it ſelfe: of veſſells, veſtments, tithes, firſtfruits, &amp;c. So on this ſide of the Court was the treaſurie of the poll money, &amp; for the poore, and for the repaire of the Temple; which more eſpecially was called <hi>Corban:</hi> The word as at the firſt and moſt properly it ſignified <hi>an offering</hi> (and ſo is it frequently uſed in <hi>Deviticus,</hi> and that is the ſenſe that we have newly parted with) ſo in the Jewes common language it came alſo to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Treaſurie of the Temple,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.6.

It appeareth by the diſtribution of the guards in the tradition cited that the guard at the chamber over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Vaile, and at the chamber of <hi>Corban</hi> were on the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſides of the Court, or elſe there were no proportion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in their ſtations. All the ſeven gates of the Court were guarded, two with Prieſts, and five with Levites: all the foure Corners of the Court were alſo guarded, and there was beſides (ſaith the tradition) <hi>a guard at the chamber of the Vaile, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the chamber of Corban, and another behinde the Mercy ſeat,</hi> that is, one on the one ſide of the Court over againſt the body of the Temple, and another on the other ſide, and another juſt behind, which was called <hi>the guard behinde the Mercy ſeate.</hi> Now where can we ſo properly looke for the chamber <hi>Corban,</hi> as between thoſe two gates that both bare that name? And the matter here ſeemeth ſomewhat nearly parallel to the caſe that we obſerved about the gates and houſe of <hi>Aſuppim</hi> upon the Weſt quarter of the mountaine of the houſe, for as there was a piece of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49920:95"/>that ran between two gates which it ſelfe was called <hi>the houſe of Aſuppim,</hi> and gave occaſion to the gates on either end of it, to be called <hi>the gates of Aſuppim;</hi> ſo here was a piece of building that ran between two gates, which it ſelfe was called <hi>Corban,</hi> and gave occaſion to the gates on either end it, to be called <hi>the gates of Corban</hi> likewiſe.</p>
               <p>To come downe therefore from the gate of <hi>Beth Mokadh,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, there was firſt a piece of building joyned to that gate, which was a treaſurie and was called <hi>Corban,</hi> and then was there a roome where the Levites kept their guard, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to that there was another treaſurie or <hi>Corban,</hi> and joyning to the Eaſt end of that, a gate called by the ſame name <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> but called alſo <hi>the gate of the women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to diſtinguiſh theſe treaſuries, whether the one of them was the treaſury for the halfe Shekel poll-money, and the other for money and veſſels offered for the uſe and repaire of the houſe, or whether one of them was the treaſurie for the Temple and the other for the poore, which diſtinction we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, it is but in vaine to inquire after, ſince it is not poſſible to reſolve when we have done all we can: onely this I ſuppoſe may not unpertinently be obſerved, that the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries wherein they put money, (whether chambers or cheſts) were thoſe that moſt properly were called <hi>Corban,</hi> rather then the treaſuries where they laid up other things: And according to the ſeverall places where theſe chambers and theſe cheſts ſtood, the place was called <hi>the Treaſurie,</hi> and <hi>the Houſe of the Treaſurie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here let us looke after a place of Scripture, which ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſomething in relation to the treaſurie, and may not unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be taken into conſideration before we part with this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

               <p>But why it is called <hi>the gate of the Song,</hi> for ought I can finde, is left alſo onely to conjecture: And I ſhall onely offer this; Becauſe they that came in at this gate came in the very face of the <hi>Levites</hi> as they ſtood in their deskes ſinging, or playing on their inſtruments and making the Temple muſicke.</p>

               <p>Of all theſe particulars we ſhall give account as we goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: And firſt it will be needfull to cleare the tearmes, of <hi>the Court of Iſrael</hi> and <hi>the Court of the Prieſts:</hi> Now theſe are to be underſtood in a ſtricter acception or in a larger: In the ſtricteſt ſenſe they were taken for the firſt ground you paſſed over as you went up from the Eaſt wall of the Court, or where the gate of <hi>Nicanor</hi> was, unto the Altar, and they are ſaid to be eleven cubits broad a piece.

                  <hi>Perexedram, along the cloiſter,</hi> round about the Court to ſee whether all was well and ſafe there. And you had mention
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49920:100"/>even now of pillars 8 cubits diſtant from the North wall of the Court, which though indeed in their very name they ſpeak that they were low pillars and not ſuch as bare up the roofe of the cloiſters, as we ſhall obſerve when we come to ſpeak of them, yet were there higher pillars by them that were ſuch Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters.</p>
               <p>On the North and South ſide therefore, and at the Weſt end of the Court, there was a cloiſter like unto thoſe that we have ſpoken of already borne up with pillars and roofed over head, that people might ſtand under unannoied of raine and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this was the Court of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that went round about the Court: for in this might lay-men ſtand, and ſo they did, when there were great multitudes at the Temple, as there was at the three feſtivalls when they were injoyned to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.

                  <hi>The Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was killed in three companies: And the firſt company went in, and the Court was filled, &amp;c.</hi> Now by the filling of the Court with people is not meant all the parts of the Court within the wall that did incloſe it, but this <hi>Court of Iſrael</hi> or cloiſter where the laity might ſtand, round about: And all inward, or what was incloſed by this cloiſter, was in the large acceptation <hi>the Court of the Prieſts:</hi> This cloiſter did not retaine the ſame ſpace of liberty of ſtanding or walking, in every part of it, for here and there there were buildings that ſtood out ſomething into it, as part of <hi>Beth Mokadh</hi> did at the North-weſt corner, and part of the building <hi>Gazith</hi> at the Southeaſt, &amp;c. yet was there ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by them made more or leſſe, that the buildings did not thruſt him that would paſſe, into the Court of the Prieſts, but that there was a ſpace to paſſe, ſometimes larger, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times narrower even all the Court round about.</p>
               <p>Now at the Eaſt part or quarter of it as you came up out of <hi>the gate of Nicanor,</hi> you entred upon that which was called in the ſtricter ſenſe, <hi>the Court of Iſrael,</hi> which was eleven cubits over as you went up towards the Altar, and then was that which alſo in the ſtricter ſenſe was called <hi>the Court of the Prieſts,</hi> and that was eleven cubits over likewiſe: Theſe two ſpaces were double cloiſtered, being roofed over, and the roofe ſupported with a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49920:100"/>double row of pillars: the one row ſtanding out to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the open Court, and the other row ſtanding where the two ſpaces parted the one from the other. Theſe were more peculiarly called <hi>the Court of Iſrael</hi> and <hi>the Court of the Prieſts</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe two or three reaſons. 1. Becauſe hither was the moſt ordinary acceſſe of Iſraelites and Prieſts in their moſt ſolemne worſhip, it being juſt in the face both of Temple and Altar. 2. Becauſe in that which was called <hi>the Court of Iſrael,</hi> the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary men did conſtantly ſtand, in their attendance on the ſervice in repreſentation of all the people, as we have ſhewed them ſuch repreſentatives,<note n="*" place="margin">Temple-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice chap. <hi>7.</hi> Sect. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> in another place: And in that which was called <hi>the Court of Prieſts,</hi> did thoſe Prieſts ſtand that had not imployment in the preſent ſervice (as all of them had not alwaies) and waited upon the worſhip and ſervice, which their brethren now in imployment were about. 3. That part of the roome <hi>Gazith</hi> which ſtood within the Court, opened into both theſe Courts; and as that was the roome, where the Prieſts caſt lots for the dividing of the ſervice amongſt them, ſo it was the chappell (as it were) where they ſaid a good part of their daily liturgie, and ſo the people and Prieſts in theſe Courts were ready to heare it. The one Court was diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from the other by ſome grates or barres or ſuch like things which the Jewes call <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: which ſtood between pillar and pillar in that middle row of pillars that bare up the roofe of the cloiſter. Into the Court of the Prieſts, whether largely or ſtrictly taken, the Iſraelites or lay people might not come but upon ſpeciall occaſion, and that occaſion was three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; namely, either to lay his hand upon the beaſt that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or to kill him, or to wave ſome part of him, and then his coming into the Court either of Iſrael or of the Prieſts or both, was ordinarily at the North or South ſide of the Court, according as his offering was to be ſlaine on the North or South ſide of the Altar, as we have obſerved before.</p>

                  <hi>Ducan was ſet above it, and in that there were three ſteps of halfe a cubit high a piece: So that the Court of the Prieſts is found to be higher then the Court of Iſrael by two cubits and an halfe.</hi> So that it appeares indeed that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites ſtood upon raiſed ſteps in their deskes, but it is plain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that the higheſt ſtep was no higher then the floore of the Court before them and that that ſtep whereon they ſtood, was not called the <hi>Dukan,</hi> but the whole place of the three ſteps riſing.</p>
               <p>And thus were the eleven cubits of the Court of the Prieſts at this Eaſt quarter of the Court taken up and divided: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two cubits and an halfe taken up by the deskes of the ſingers (for as was the height of the ſteps, ſo was their breadth) and eight cubits and an halfe for the Prieſts ſtanding. The Court of <hi>Iſrael</hi> parted from the Levites desks, by pillars and railes: The Levites ſtanding parted from the Prieſts by a wainſcot deske or ſome ſuch thing.

                  <hi>The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the chaire</hi> or ſeat, upon what miſtake in their unprickt bible, a mean Hebrician will eaſily diſcover, namely that they read <hi>Muſadh</hi> for <hi>Muſach</hi> (<hi>Daleph</hi> and <hi>Caph finall</hi> being like) and for <hi>Shabbath</hi> they read <hi>Shebeth.</hi>

Ibid.</note> The moſt received opinion about this matter is, that this was ſome ſpeciall piece of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that was purpoſely made for the courſe of Prieſts that went out every Sabbath to repoſe themſelves in, till the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was out, or till they might goe home. And the reaſon of this conception is becauſe of the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to referre rather to the change of the Prieſts courſes, who came in and went out on the Sabbath, then to the ſervice, or the peoples attending, whoſe concourſe was greater at the feſtivalls then on the Sabbath; I ſhould rather take it to meane ſome Court of guard that was made on the Top of the cauſey <hi>Shallecheth</hi> up towards the gate <hi>Coponius,</hi> where the Kings guard ſtood on the Sabbaths having attended the King into the Temple, till he came out againe, there to receive him againe and to guard him home: and I ſhould underſtand and conſtrue the word <hi>The Kings</hi> in conjunction with both particulars na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, namely that it meaneth the Kings covert of the Sabbath as well as the Kings entry without: and my reaſon for this opinion I ſhould fetch partly from the mention of theſe gates that we had in ſpeech before, namely, <hi>The gate of the foundation,</hi> and <hi>the gate behinde the guard,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 11.6. And partly from the paſſage in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 38.14. where it is ſaid that <hi>King Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiab ſent and tooke Jeremy the Prophet unto him into the third entry that was in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> where <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi> doth inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſſe that he knowes not what this <hi>third entry in the houſe of the Lord</hi> was: <hi>but perhaps</hi> ſaith he <hi>it meaneth the Court of Iſrael; the Court of the women and the Chel being the two other. Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> doth well conceive that this entry was as they came from the Kings houſe into the Temple, but more of it he hath not determined. I ſhould ſay it meaneth the gate <hi>Coponius:</hi> and conceive the King coming to the Temple, through theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances or paſſages. Firſt at the bottome of the ſtaires or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49920:103"/>of <hi>Sion,</hi> much about his turning to come upon the cauſey there was <hi>the gate of the foundation,</hi> then being come up the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey towards the Temple, he paſſed through <hi>the gate behinde the guard</hi> and walked through the Court of Guard which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was called <hi>the Kings covert for the Sabbath,</hi> and ſo through <hi>the gate Coponius</hi> which was his third entrance or gate he paſſed through. Theſe gates we ſaid before, were gates of <hi>Sion,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they were in the way from the Temple thither, and not gates of the Temple it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>According therefore to this ſuppoſall, I apprehend that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> becoming a Renegado to religion, did deface and defile the Temple within, and did cleane cut off the way of the Kings acceſſe thither without, as if he and his ſhould never have more to doe there: And according to this ſuppoſall alſo I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> having gariſoned himſelfe in the Temple, while the Chaldeans were now lying in ſiege about the city, he ſends for <hi>Jeremy</hi> from his priſon in <hi>Zion,</hi> and he comes up to the gate <hi>Coponius</hi> or <hi>Shallecheth,</hi> and there the King and He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre together. And now let us turne our eyes and obſervation upon what is to be found in the Court from which we have thus farre digreſſed: and firſt we will begin with the Altar: which is not onely the moſt remarkable thing to be obſerved there, but which muſt alſo ſerve us as a ſtanding marke, from whence to meaſure the place and ſight of other things.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Altar that <hi>Moſes</hi> made in the wilderneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was to be carried up and downe, was of light materialls and of ſmall dimenſions: for<note n="[a]" place="margin">Exod. <hi>27.1.</hi>
                  </note> it was of Shittim-wood, and but five cubits ſquare, and three cubits high, with a grate of braſſe hanging within it for the fire and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to lye upon. And therefore when it is called <hi>the brazen Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.5. it is becauſe it was plated over with braſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 38.1. But when <hi>Solomon</hi> came to build the Temple, and there was to be no more removing of the Tabernacle of the Congregation as there had been before,<note n="[b]" place="margin">
                     <hi>2</hi> Chron. <hi>4.1.</hi>
                  </note> he made the Altar farre larger and weightier then that of <hi>Moſes:</hi> namely of braſſe and of twenty cubite ſquare and ten cubits high.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not be curious to inquire whether <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar were of braſſe indeed or no, or whether it is ſaid to be of braſſe, though it were of ſtone, becauſe it ſucceeded in ſtead of <hi>Moſes</hi> his brazen one as<note n="[c]" place="margin">Vid.

                  </note> ſome Jewes conceive,<note n="[d]" place="margin">Vid. Lev. Gerſ. ibid.</note> or as others, becauſe though it were of ſtone, yet it was overlaid with braſſe: I ſee no reaſon why it ſhould not be properly and literally underſtood that it was of maſſie braſſe indeed: for why may we not well conclude by the plating of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Altar over with braſſe, that it was made of wood onely for lightneſſe, and had it not been for that, it had been all of braſſe as well as the outſide: And that that outſide plating, might be a warrant to <hi>Solomon</hi> to make his Altar of Maſſie braſſe: It is true indeed that there is a command of making an Altar of Earth or ſtone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. but it may very well be queſtioned, whether theſe altars meant not ſuch as were made upon ſpeciall and emergent occaſions, namely upon the Lords ſingular appearing to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as to <hi>Gedeon, Manoah</hi> and others, who upon ſuch appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances built Altars and ſacrificed. <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.19. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.30, 31.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:49920:104"/>
               <p>There is but little to be diſcovered about the exact faſhion and fabrick, of <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar, becauſe the Scripture ſpeaketh very conciſely of it: For it ſaith onely thus, <hi>He made an Altar of Braſſe, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.1. So that it was foure times as big in it ſquare, as was the Altar made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and three times as high, and a cubit over: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were exactly of the faſhion of that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as whether the middle ſpace within its ſquare were hollow like his, or made up with ſtone, and whether it had a grated hearth like his or a ſolid, and what was the manner of the aſcending and going up to it, may be rather apprehended by ſuppoſall, then certainely knowne by any ſcripturall deſcription or demonſtration.</p>
               <p>The ſacrifices that are recorded to have been offered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at once, both upon the Altar of <hi>Moſes</hi> and that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom,</hi> are exceeding wonderfull, and may cauſe a man to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, how ſo vaſt numbers ſhould be laid and burnt in ſo little a ſpace as even the larger of them was of, though a very large time ſhould be allowed for it: as <hi>Solomons</hi> 1000. ſacrifices up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Moſes</hi> his Altar, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.4. and the peoples 700. oxen and 7000. ſheep upon <hi>Solomons,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.11, &amp;c. <hi>Moſes</hi> his Altar was but five cubits ſquare, and how long a time might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for 1000. beaſts whole-burnt-offerings, for ſo they are called, to be burnt in ſo ſmall a compaſſe? <hi>David Kimchi</hi> upon that place and ſtory gloſſeth thus. <hi>He offered not all theſe ſacrifices in one day, but before he returned againe from Gibeon to Jeruſalem: yet it ſeemeth by our Rabbines that they tooke it to be done at one time.</hi> The greateſt ſolemnities that ever were at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> laſted ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily but ſeven daies; or at the utmoſt but fourteene, when they would double their feſtivity, as at the dedication of the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.65. now grant <hi>Solomon</hi> fourteene, nay twice fourteene dayes ſtay at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> yet will it ſeeme difficult that he ſhould diſpatch ſo many ſacrifices even in that time. And at his owne Altar at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> how vaſt is the number of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that is mentioned, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.63. <hi>And Solomon offered a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of peace-offerings, which he offered to the Lord, two and twenty thouſand oxen and an hundred and twenty thouſand ſheepe: ſo the King and all the children of Iſrael dedicated the houſe of the Lord.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49920:104"/>The ſame day did the King hallow the middle of the Court, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Allow the whole fourteene daies that are ſpoken of in ver. 65. unto this buſineſſe, and yet the text ſeemes to limit it to a ſhorter time, and for all that, a man may rather ſtand amazed at ſuch a thing as this doing, then find out any ſatisfactory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion how it ſhould be done. Sure the divine fire upon the Altar, was of a more ſingular quickneſſe of diſpatch then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fires: or elſe I know not what can be ſaid to theſe things. The Jewes do reckon ſeverall wonders that were continually acted at the Temple, as that no flies infeſted that place, though there were ſo much ſlaughtering of beaſts there, and that the ſmoke of the Altar alwayes went ſtraight up and was never blowne aſide by the winde, &amp;c. which though it may be they are the leſſe beleeved for the relators ſakes, yet certainly well weighed in themſelves they carry very good ſenſe and reaſon in them. For who would have been able in the ſummer to have ſtood in the Court neare the Altar where there was ſo much blood ſhed, and fleſh ſtirring, if the ſlaughter place there had been troubled with ſtink, flies and waſpes, as our common ſlaughter houſes are? And how reeky and ſmokie a place would the Temple and all the places about it have been, and how would thoſe that attended the ſervice, have been choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſtifled, and no man able to have indured in the Court, if the ſmoak from off the Altar had been blowne up and down with every puffe of winde, as we ordinarily ſee ſmoak to be? So that for the prevention of ſuch unconveniences as theſe which would have made the ſervice intolerable and unacceſſible, we cannot but acknowledge a continuall miraculous providence and diſpenſation. And ſo in this particular that we have in hand: that multitudes of ſacrifices, ſuch as were eſpecially at the three feſtivalls, ſhould be diſpatched by the fire within the time allotted for the offering of ſuch ſacrifices, is rather to be aſcribed to miracle then to any thing elſe. The Altar is called <hi>Ariel, the Lords lion,</hi> as we ſhall obſerve by and by, and it was a lion of a very quick devouring.</p>
               <p>Now whereas it is ſaid that <hi>Solomon did hallow the middle of the Court that was before the houſe of the Lord, for there he offered burnt-offerings and meat-offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49920:105"/>becauſe the brazen Altar that was before the Lord was too little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them:</hi> lay this alſo in too, and yet it will be difficult enough to apprehend the diſpatch of ſo many thouſand ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in ſo ſhort a time, if this conſideration be not alſo laid in therewithall. But the queſtion that is moſt ordinarily raiſed out of theſe words is, in what ſenſe to underſtand this hallowing of the middle of the Court: whether he burnt the ſacrifices upon the very pavement, as is the opinion of <hi>Rabbi Judah,</hi> or whether he ſet up <hi>Moſes</hi> Altar by his owne Altar and offered on it, or whether he built an Altar of ſtone by his brazen one, for theſe opinions are alſo held, but me thinkes the greater queſtion is about the place, and what is meant by <hi>the middle of the Court?</hi> Upon which quaere, theſe two things, may firſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into obſervation. 1. That fire from heaven in the time of <hi>David,</hi> had apponted out the exact place of offering ſacrifice or of the Altar, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. and to go about that piece of ſervice in any other place of the Court, required either a propheticall warrant, or a diſpenſation through meere neceſſity, both which diſpenſers were concurred here. 2. That this place which <hi>Solomon</hi> hallowed in the Court, was hallowed by the very ſervice performed upon it; The Altar of <hi>Moſes</hi> was hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed at its firſt ſetting up, by being anointed, and ſo doe the Jewes, not without good ground, aſſert that <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar was hallowed likewiſe: but this neceſſitated place, for ſo let me call it, which <hi>Solomon</hi> was conſtrained to ſet apart for that ſervice, was not ſo ſerved, but his very ſacrificing there did hallow the place: namely for ſuch a preſent imployment, but not for future. And ſo the current of the text may be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he hallowed the middle of the Court, for there he offered burnt-offerings: ſo that whereas the other altar, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed ſanctified the gift, this extraordinary Altar did not ſo much ſanctifie the offering at the firſt, as was ſanctified by it: And ſo the Temple after the returne out of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and all the utenſills belonging to it, were ſanctified by the very ſervice, for there was neither divine fire, nor any cloud of glory, nor any anointing oile to ſanctifie them.</p>

And therefore whereas it was ſaid before, that the breadth of the Altar and its riſe was 62 cubits from North to South, it is to be ſo taken, as that the riſe is to be accounted a thing different from the Altar it ſelfe, and lying a great ſpace further out then the compaſſe of the Altar did, as we ſhall ſee anon: Now this foundation which is ſaid to be 32 cubits ſquare every way, did not hold the compleate meaſure of a cubit broad in every part of it, but in the Southeaſt corner of it, it wanted ſomewhat to make the corner a perfect angle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the other corners.

               <p>You need not marvaile if he goe alone in his opinion when you looke upon it, and how it is ſtrained, and eſpecially from this pinch, becauſe though the Altar of <hi>Solomon</hi> is called <hi>brazen,</hi> yet he holds it to have been of ſtone, and overlaid: were it of braſſe or were it of ſtone, <hi>Ahaz</hi> his modeſty was not ſo much but that he would pull it downe to ſerve his turne as well as remove it.

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:49920:113"/>modeſty was a little more then <hi>Ahaz</hi> had; for he had ſet his Altar behinde the Altar of the Lord, betwixt it and the Eaſt gate, ſo that the Lords Altar was betwixt that new-found one and the Temple (it ſeemeth the ſpace at the entring in from the Eaſt gate, was more open in the times of the firſt Temple then it was in the ſecond.) But when <hi>Ahaz</hi> comes, he removes <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar towards the North, and brings up his own and ſets it in the place of it, and ſo does as it were ſupplant the Lord of his poſſeſſion and uſurpe upon it, putting the Lords Altar out of uſe as well as out of its place, and giving his owne the greatneſſe becauſe it was the greater, in the imployment for all the Sacrifices that were to be offered, both ordinary and extraordinary, both of the King and People: while the Altar of the Lord muſt ſtand by as a cypher, onely with this dignity, which was leſſe then none at all, <hi>The brazen Altar ſhall be for me to ſeeke to when I thinke good.</hi> As for the departure of the divine fire from off the Altar, which had come downe in the daies of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of which our <hi>Rabbin</hi> ſpeaketh, it is not unworthy ſome of the Readers thoughts: For the Temple was ſo oft prophaned, yea and ſometimes ſhut up, before the captivity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Babel,</hi> as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.7. &amp; 28.24. &amp;c. that it is hardly to be imagined, but that the fire which had been continued from the deſcent of that divine fire, was at ſome of theſe times or other extinguiſhed.

That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a ſtanding on the North ſide of the Court as well as on the Eaſt, which though it was not nor indeed could be exactly eleven cubits broad as was their ſtation at the Eaſt end, yet was it a ſtation for them as well as that: And our author when he ſpeaketh of <hi>the place where the feate of the Iſraelites trod, of eleven cubits broad,</hi> and of <hi>the place where the feete of the Prieſts trod of eleven cubits broad:</hi> he meaneth not that there was ſuch a ſpace for the Iſraelites and the Prieſts to ſtand in all along the North ſide of the Court as there was in the Eaſt, but his meaning is this, that when the ſacrifices to be ſlaine on the North ſide of the Altar were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding many indeed, that rather then want roome to kill them, they ſhould not onely ſlay them in the place of the rings, but even in the ſtanding of the Prieſts and Iſraelites at the Eaſt end, namely ſo farre on that ground, as lay even with that ſpace that was on the North ſide of the Altar: and ſo might they uſe the like ſpace all along the North ſide of the Court for the ſame purpoſe even to beyond the Weſt end of the Temple. 2.

I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I have read of what matter the Laver of the ſecond Temple was made, whether of braſſe, or ſtone Conduit-like: for to hold it of wood is very unſuitable to the exceeding great ſtatelineſſe of the Temple in other things: yet were it of wood, it would have been a very hard taske for any one man to manage it in that manner as they doe a bucket in a Well, be the Engine of <hi>Ben Kattins</hi> making never ſo active, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly contrived;<note n="[l]" place="margin">Maym. ubi ſupr.</note> and therefore <hi>Maimonides</hi> leaves it as a thing of doubtfulneſſe, about letting it downe into the Well, for, ſaith he, <hi>they let it downe into a gathering of waters, or into the Wel, and on the morrow drew it up, or they filled it every day in the morning.</hi>

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49920:121"/>in all other particulars of the Temple he ſhewed and provided for magnificence as well as he did for neceſſary uſe and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies: ſo in this proviſion for water for the occaſions of the Temple, he did not only take care for abundance, but he did it with that coſt and ſumptuouſneſſe, that only himſelfe in the other things he did can ſhew a parallel. I beleeve neither any ſtory, nor any Founders Art, did or will ever ſhew ſuch, maſter-pieces of Workmanſhip in that skill and in that mettle, as were his Lavers and his molten Sea: and the Holy-Ghoſt hath been as copious and preciſe in the deſcription of theſe two, but eſpecially of the former, as in any piece of Art or Workmanſhip, eſpecially of that bigneſſe in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The great addition that <hi>Solomon</hi> made to the firſt patterne, in the number of Candleſtickes, Shewbread tables, and Lavers, was not onely in ſtate neither, but ſomething in figure ſeemeth to have gone along with it; namely, that there might be ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the abundance of light, bread of life, and Purifying, that was to be exhibited in and by him whom the Temple did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent: And as <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſingle parcels did hold out a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of theſe things themſelves; ſo his decuplated number did hold out the happy abundance of them to be found in him that is all light, life, and holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>The Lavers, ten in number, and all of one mold, cize, and faſhion, were for the waſhing of the parts of the Sacrifices that were to be waſhed, as the Sea was for the bathing of the Prieſts. Their ſituation was five on either ſide the Court, over againſt the Altar and place of ſlaughtering, as evenly and convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they could be ſet: For howſoever<note n="[b]" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> ſome of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors have been of a mind, that all the ten Tables of ſhewbread that <hi>Solomon</hi> made ſtood on one ſide of the houſe, and the Table that <hi>Moſes</hi> made juſt in the middeſt of them, and the like by the ten Candleſticks and the ten Lavers; yet is the Text ſo plaine about the Lavers that they were placed five on the one ſide of the houſe and five on the other, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.39. that it do not only put the matter out of all doubt for them, but it doth confirme the like for the two other ſufficiently, if there were no other confirmation.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, there was a flat piece of braſſe, of a very great cize for length, breadth, and thickneſſe, borne upon four wheels: ſuch pieces are not to be ſeen in theſe our daies, and it is great oddes that no daies have ſhewed ſuch but only theſe; for every piece is ſaid to be <hi>four cubits long, and four cubits broad, and three cubits high:</hi> and ſince in the world we cannot finde a piece of braſſe to parallel them withall, we muſt compare them to ſomething of another materiall, and ſo let us liken them for proportion to a ſtone or marble Table of thoſe dimenſions.

Of theſe two things the latter ſeemeth to be the more probable upon theſe two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe it is not ſaid, <hi>the thickneſſe,</hi> but <hi>the height of it</hi> was three cubits, as ſhewing that it meaneth not the maſſy thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the piece, but that as it ſtood ſupporting the Laver, the ſurface of it was ſo high from the ground.</p>

There was no need of ſo vaſt a thickneſſe, either for the weight that it was to carry, or for the ſumptuouſneſs that it was to bear, but half ſuch a thickneſſe would more then abundantly diſcharge both the one and the other.

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The Molten Sea.</head>
                  <p>IT was an equall wonder of Art, that ſo great and vaſt a veſſell as the molten Sea ſhould be caſt, and that when it was caſt it ſhould be got up from the plaine of <hi>Jordan</hi> where it was caſt, to the Temple: Being brought thither, it was ſet upon twelve brazen oxen, at the Eaſt end of the Court of the Prieſts towards the North-eaſt corner.</p>
                  <p>The dimenſions and contents of it are thus accounted by the booke of <hi>Kings, It was ten cubits from the one brim to the other, it was round all about, and his height was five cuhits, and a line of thirty cubits did compaſſe it round about: And it contained two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand haths,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.23.26. with which account the booke of <hi>Chronicles</hi> doth agree exactly in every point but onely in the laſt, and there it differeth exceedingly, for it ſaith <hi>it contained three thouſand haths,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.5. Now that difference breedeth no ſmall difficulty how to reconcile it, and that is not all the difficulty in this ſtory of the molten Sea neither, for it is not eaſie to caſt, how ſo ſmall a compaſſe (though it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a huge compaſſe for one veſſell) ſhould containe ſo great a quantity of water. The <hi>Bath</hi> of the Hebrewes which was the greateſt liquid meaſure that they had in uſe, was within a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little (a pint or ſuch a thing) even and equall with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of our Engliſh buſhell, or 8 gallons: now how a veſſell of but 5 cubits deepe and often cubits from ſide to ſide, ſhould containe 3000 baths, or neare upon 24000 gallons of water, is of ſome difficulty to imagine: The cubit in this veſſell is to be taken parallel to its meaſure in other veſſels and parts of the Temple, and ſo that particular will helpe nothing to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. The Jewes have deſervedly taken this ſcruple into their conſideration and diſpute; and the concluſion that they have made upon the doubt and debate is this,<note n="[a]" place="margin">Talm. in Erubhin per. in Gemar. &amp; R.

And they ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that the upper part of it, namely for the height of the two upper cubits it was round, and they contracting into the round and circular forme did ſo much take in the compaſſe which lay out in the foure corners of the quadrangle below, that now it was but thirty cubits about, according as the text ſaith, that <hi>a line of thirty cubits did compaſſe it round about.</hi> In which aſſertion although they ſpeak that; which is uncouth, and not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily apprehended upon this matter, yet is their diſpute ſo ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall if it ſhould particularly be given at length, that if it be not found on the ſuddaine worth the beleeving, yet certainly is the matter very well worth the conſidering, and ſo be it left to conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Now as for the difference which is betweene the booke of <hi>Kings</hi> &amp; the book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> about the contents of this veſſell (which is a doubt more obvious and conſpicuous to the eye) whileſt one ſaith <hi>it contained two thouſand baths,</hi> and the other, <hi>three thouſand,</hi> the anſwer that is given generally by the Hebrew writers, may be ſome ſatisfaction (which is, that of liquid it contained but two thouſand baths, but of dry things that would lye heaped above the brim, it would hold three) though I beleeve there is more in it. The molten Sea was for the Prieſts waſhing themſelves in it againſt they went about the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.6. Now their waſhing being twofold, either of their hands and feet, or of their whole bodies, this veſſell ſerved for both, but in diverſe manner: Their hands and feet they waſhed in the water that ran out by ſome cocks and ſpouts out of it, but for the waſhing or bathing of their bodies they went downe into the veſſell it ſelfe: Now had it been alwaies full of water to the brim, it had been too deepe for them to ſtand in, and would hazzard their drowning; therefore there was ſuch
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49920:125"/>a gage ſet by cocks or pipes running out continually, that the water was kept at ſuch a height, as ſhould ſerve for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe abundantly, and yet ſhould not at all indanger their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And ſo may we very well reconcile the difference in queſtion by ſuppoſing, that the text that ſaith that <hi>it contained two thouſand bathes</hi> meaneth, the common and conſtant quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water that was in it, that was fit and ſerved for their waſhing, and the other that ſaith <hi>it contained three thouſand haths,</hi> meaneth that it would hold ſo much being filled up to the brim.</p>
                  <p>About the body of this huge veſſell, there were two borders of ingravings, the worke of which the booke of <hi>Kings</hi> calleth <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The ſupply of water to theſe huge veſſels (and that ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly that they were not onely alwaies full, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ran out and yet were full ſtill) was from the well <hi>Etam</hi> of which we have ſpoken before: And the <hi>Jeruſalem Talmud</hi> in the treatiſe <hi>Joma,</hi> ſpeaking particularly of this molten Sea, and how it was for the Prieſts to bath their bodies in againſt they came to the ſervice, it propoſeth this queſtion<note n="[d]" place="margin">Talm.

                  <p>IT will not be much neceſſary to ſpend large diſcourſe upon this ſubject about the garments of the ordinary Prieſts which they wore in the ſervice, ſince we have deſcribed the veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the High-prieſt at large in another place, who wore all the ſame garments that the other prieſts did, but he wore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, we ſhall therefore but briefly touch theſe particulars concerning them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the garments wherewithall the Prieſts were arrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they were about divine ſervice, were peculiar for that place and occaſion, and differing from the garments that they uſed in their ordinary wearing. Some Jewes thinke there were ſuch Prieſtly garments before the law, and they ſpeak of ſuch, bequeathed from father to ſonne in the holy line even from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and they think the veſture in which <hi>Jacob</hi> obtained the bleſſing was of this nature: but about this we ſhall not be inquiſitive.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Prieſts when they were come up in their courſes to the ſervice, put off their ordinary wearing clothes, waſhed themſelves in water, and put on the holy garments: See <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.6.<note n="[a]" place="margin">Tamid. per. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> Yea whilſt they were at the Temple and attending there on the ſervice, any of them that would ſleep by night, he ſlept not in the holy garments, but in his own wearing clothes, and in the morning when he was to goe to his ſervice, he put off his owne clothes, bathed himſelfe in water, and put on the garments of the Prieſt-hood. Theſe expreſſions in Scripture, <hi>Put off the old man, and be renewed and put on the new, Epheſ.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. <hi>Put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Baptized into Chriſt, and putting on Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Waſhed from our ſinnes and made Prieſts, Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Not unclothed but clothed upon,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. ſeeme to allude to this cuſtome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The holy garments of the Prieſts were of white linnen,<note n="[b]" place="margin">Rab. Sol. in Exod. <hi>28.</hi>
                     </note> and they conſiſted of foure parcels whereas the High-prieſts
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49920:128"/>garments were of eight parcels, and they were of other colours as well as white: And, as hath been obſerved elſewhere, every Prieſt was firſt tried by the <hi>Sanbedrin,</hi> whether he were right and fit, and being ſo found he had his white garments put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, all which garments were found at the publick charge. <hi>The man clothed with linnen with a writers inkborne by his ſide, Ezek.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Walking with Chriſt in white, Rev.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Araying in white robes, Rev.</hi> 7.9, &amp;c. doe ſeeme to referre to this holy garbe and colour of the Prieſts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Upon their feet they wore nothing at all whilſt they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but ſtood in the Court barefooted, were it never ſo cold; nay though they were barefooted, yet might they not ſtand upon any thing to keep their feet from the cold pavement, but muſt ſtand barely upon that, were the ſervice never ſo long and the ſeaſon never ſo ſharpe: The reaſon of their barefoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe was becauſe of the holineſſe of the ground, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 5.15. and the reaſon of their ſtanding onely on the bare ſtones, was to ſhew their fervour and zeal to the ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Upon their thighes and loins they wore linnen breeches to prevent the diſcovery of their nakedneſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.42. ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they ſtood upright aloft upon the Altar, or when they ſtooped downe to any worke of the ſervice either there or in any other place.

                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. <hi>And the hands of a man were under their wings on their four ſides; ſo had they four their faces and their wings.</hi>) That is, they had their faces and their wings on their four ſides: namely, a wing on their breaſt and a face that way, a wing on the backe and a face that way, and a wing on either ſhoulder and faces likewiſe, and under their wings every way was a mans hand and arme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. <hi>Their wings were joining one to another.</hi>) This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained at <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They turned not about when they went, they went every one ſtraight before his face</hi>) Which way ſoever they were to goe, they needed not to turne their bodies, to ſet their face that way as men and other creatures do; who when they are to goe this way or that way, they turne their bodies till their faces ſtand the way they are to goe: but theſe did not, nor needed they to doe ſo; for goe which way they would, they had a face that led them that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. <hi>As for the likeneſſe of their faces &amp;c.</hi>) Every one had the face of a Man before, and the face of an Eagle behinde, the face of a Lion towards the right hand, and the face of a Bullock towards the left.</p>
               <p>It is not much important to diſpute, whether they had foure heads as well as faces, or only one head faced on every ſide; I ſhould rather hold for the former, and could give ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſway me to that opinion, but I ſhall not inſiſt upon them here.</p>
               <p>Some there have been that have conceived that the quarters of their faces are named in reference to their ſtanding towards <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as that the face towards <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was a mans, the face which was upon <hi>Ezekiels</hi> right hand (which was the left hand
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49920:131"/>of the <hi>Cherub</hi>) was a Lions; the face on <hi>Ezekiels</hi> left hand (which was the <hi>Cherubs</hi> right) the face of a Bullock; and the face of an Eagle behinde: but they that have been of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion have not obſerved, that the foure living creatures ſtood not in a ſtraight line all facing <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but in a ſquare poſture, as ſhall be ſhewed by and by.</p>
               <p>Theſe living Creatures are called Cherubins by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet very often, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. and by that name, laid to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, he teacheth us how to conceive of the forme of the <hi>Cherubins</hi> that we read of ſo oft in Scripture, as the <hi>Cherubins</hi> upon the Mercy ſeat, and the <hi>Cherubins</hi> that overſhadowed the Arke in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, and the <hi>Cherubins</hi> wrought in the Tabernacle Curtaines, and carved upon the Temple wals, &amp;c. namely, of this four-fold feature or having ſo many faces; ſaving that in the imbroidery of the Curtaines and ſculpture upon the wals, only two of the four faces could be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. And ſo it is evident in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 41.19. where he ſaith there were <hi>Cherubins</hi> and Palm trees carved upon the walls, <hi>ſo that a Palm tree was between a Cherub and a Cherub, and every Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub bad two faces: ſo that the face of a man was towards the Palme tree on the one ſide, and the face of a young lion was towards the Palme tree on the other ſide.</hi> Their other two faces were to be conceived obſcured in the wall as if they were looking into it. But it may not paſſe unobſerved that theſe two faces of a man and a lion, were not the cherubs oppoſite faces, that is, that before and that behinde, but they were his face before and his face on the right ſide: and hence I have one reaſon to conjecture that they had foure heads as well as foure faces, becauſe it will otherwiſe be very harſh to imagine how his fore-face and right ſide-face ſhould be ſet to looke before and behinde. Now theſe two faces of a Man and a Lion were the faces that the <hi>Cherub</hi> that ſtood upon the right hand of the Arke as it ſtood facing the people, looked upon the Arke and the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, his humane face toward the Arke, his Lions towards the people: And we ſhall obſerve afterward how thoſe whom the <hi>Cherubins</hi> repreſented, had in office to looke mutually towards God and his people, and were Mediators between them.</p>
               <p>The Prophet in <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. reckoning the four faces of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49920:131"/>theſe <hi>Cherubins</hi> againe, begins with the face of a bullock firſt, which was a left hand face, and inſtead of <hi>the face of a bullocke,</hi> he cals it <hi>the face of a Cherub:</hi> was not the face of a Lion or Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the face of a <hi>Cherub,</hi> as well as the face of a Bullocke? It ſeemeth ſtrange therefore that he ſhould call the Bullocks face, the face of a <hi>Cherub</hi> rather then any other: But the reaſon ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be taken from this conſideration: The High-prieſt when he went into the moſt holy place up to the Arke, the <hi>Cherub</hi> that ſtood by the Arke upon his right hand, whither he was more ready to looke then on his left, ſtood facing him with the face of a Bullocke. Now the Prophet in this place is ſpeaking of Gods glory flitting from the Temple, where it dwelt eſpecially on the Arke between the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> and as if he looked at that right hand <hi>Cherub,</hi> which was now flitting from his ſtation and removing, ſo he nameth that face that looked upon him: and he calleth the face of a bullocke, the face of a <hi>Cherub,</hi> becauſe that was the face of the <hi>Cherub</hi> that was moſt looked on and obſerved by him that went into the moſt holy place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. <hi>Thus were their faces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and their wings were parted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>) Though their wings joined one to another at the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on, yet they opened and parted upward, as alſo do the wings of other flying fowls: who though they grow neere together at the rootes, yet they ſpread and part wider and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der toward the points: And the like in ſome parity may be conceived concerning the parting of their faces, that they grew upon one root as if were but parted upward, into ſo many heads: and ſo the conſtruction of the verſe ſeemeth to carry it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, where the Particle in the beginning of the verſe is not ordinary, and requireth obſervation: It may very well be rendred, <hi>Bvth their faces and their wings were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upward.</hi>

The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick</hi> cals them <hi>living Creatures,</hi> and numbreth them foure, and nameth their four faces punctually as this Prophet doth,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49920:132"/>but reckoneth their wings to be ſix ape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hee ſaw foure living Creatures, with four faces, and in all things like to theſe deſcribed here, as to their forme and proportion, and he ſaith <hi>every one of them had ſix wings, Eſay</hi> 6.2.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith no leſſe as to that matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſpeak it not ſo very plainly out: for laying <hi>verſe</hi> 11. and <hi>verſe</hi> 23. together, we ſhall finde the account of their wings to be to this purpoſe, and the ſame number. <hi>They had wings that were parted above:</hi> theſe were the two wherewithall they flew: And they had other <hi>two which joined one to another,</hi> over their heads, theſe are parallel to thoſe wherewithall <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith they covered their faces: and they had <hi>two wherewithall they covered their bodies:</hi> thoſe are they that he ſaith <hi>covered their feet:</hi> Thus is the eleventh verſe to be underſtood: which the 24 ſpeaketh parallel to, and ſomething explaineth. It is ſaid there, that <hi>under the firmament</hi> (which was over their heads) <hi>their wings were ſtraight one towards another: and they had two wings which covered on this ſide, and two wings which covered on that ſide:</hi> and the meaning thereof is this, that they alwayes carryed two of their wings ſtraight upright, joining together over their heads, and when they ſtood ſtill they covered their bodies with four wings, two on back and belly, and two on either ſide: Whereas it is ſaid in verſe 24. that <hi>when they ſtood they let downe their wings,</hi> it is to be underſtood onely of thoſe two wings wherewithall they flew, for they had every one of them two wings that they never let downe, and they were thoſe wherewithall they covered their faces; and they had two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which they never lift up, and they were thoſe wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they covered their back and belly, or ſecret parts before and behinde. For that expreſſion of <hi>Eſay, They covered their feet,</hi> meaneth, <hi>they covered their ſecret parts:</hi> for in that ſenſe is <hi>feet</hi> ſometime taken in Scripture, as <hi>The baire of the feet, Eſay</hi> 7.20.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:49920:132"/>
               <p>And thus are we to reconcile thoſe two verſes in this firſt chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which ſeem to be diſſonant, the one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, namely, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. ſaith that with two of their wings they covered their bodies; and the other, which is <hi>verſe</hi> 23. ſpeakes of four that covered their bodies; which mean diſtinctly thus, that two of their wings continually covered their ſecret parts before and behinde, and they never lifted them up; and when they ſtood ſtill, they let downe their wings wherewith they flew, and with them covered their ſides. And ſo it appeareth that their two flying wings grew out at their ſhoulders, and the wings wherewith they covered their faces, grew out at their breaſt and backe, and thoſe grew out below them that covered their ſecret parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. <hi>And they went every one before his face whitherſoever their minde was to goe, &amp;c.</hi>) Went they backward, forward, ſide-way, any way, they had every one a face to goe that way, and needed no turning about to ſet their faces that way they would goe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. <hi>Their appearance was like burning coales of fire, &amp;c.</hi>) Hence <hi>Eſay</hi> calleth them <hi>Seraphim,</hi> or <hi>burning ones;</hi> and that the rather, becauſe fire is there threatned to the Temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It went between the living Creatures, &amp;c.</hi>) <hi>It,</hi> that is, <hi>fire:</hi> Every one of the living Creatures was of a glowing and flaming brightneſſe, glowing like coals of burning fire, and flaming like Lamps, and yet beſides this firineſſe that they carryed every one with them, there was fire alſo in the midſt of them, of a great brightneſſe and flaſhing as lightning: So in <hi>Rev</hi> 4.5. <hi>Out of the Throne went lightnings and thunders and voices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus was the appearance of theſe <hi>Cherubims,</hi> one thing more being added out of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.12. <hi>That their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings were full of eyes:</hi> The like is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.6. Now their poſture or manner of ſtanding was ſuch, that ſtanding ſtill or moving, they were in a ſquare forme, as if four men ſhould ſtand ſo, as to make a ſquare ſpace or a quadrangle in the middeſt between them: Their quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſtanding, was (as I may ſo expreſſe it) lozenge-wiſe, or after the Diamond ſquare, one looking toward the South with his humane face, and another with his humane face towards
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49920:133"/>the North, a third with the ſame face toward the Eaſt, and the fourth with the ſame towards the Weſt. Thus they ſtood when they ſtood, and in this quadrature they moved when they moved: and to this ſenſe is that paſſage to be underſtood in <hi>chap.</hi> 10.6, 7. where it is ſaid that fire was between the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,</hi> and one of them raught fire from between them, that is, out of the ſquare ſpace that was in the middeſt of them as they ſtood. And ſo is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.15. which is the next verſe that comes to be explained, to be underſtood.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49920:133"/>to ſet themſelves to goe that way, but they readily turned upon the croſſing ring and needed no more adoe.</p>
               <p>And thus did the living Creatures ſtand in one ſquare, and the wheeles in another ſquare about them: And let us take a patterne of their motion, ſuppoſing the living Creatures to ſtand with their humane faces looking ſeverally to the foure quarters of heaven. Were they to move Eaſt, he that ſtood Eaſt his humane face led him, and his wheele ran before him; He that ſtood Weſt, his Eagles face led him, and his wheel follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; He that ſtood South, his face of a Bullocke led him; and he that ſtood North, his Lions face led him, and their wheels ran beſide them: Were they to turne ſuddainly South? he that ſtood South, his humane face led him, he that ſtood North, his Eagles, he on the Eaſt his Lions, and he on the North his Bullocks, and now the wheels ran upon the other ring.</p>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49920:134"/>which they held upright over their heads covering their faces with them: Above that skie a Throne, on which ſate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a man all fiery; from his loines upward like fire glowing, and from his loines downward like fire flaming: and a brightneſs in the form of a rain-bow round about him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.2.3.</p>
               <p>And now to take up the morall or ſignification of this <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme,</hi> we will firſt begin with the conſideration of the generall intention of it, and then deſcend to the application of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>That it intends in generall to ſignifie and character out unto us, the Lords glory and preſence dwelling at his Temple, and among his people, theſe obſervations will make it paſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or peradventure.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Temple is very commonly in Scripture ſtyled by the name of Gods <hi>Throne,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.12. A glorious high Throne from the beginning is the place of our Sanctuary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.7. <hi>The place of my Throne, and the place of the ſoles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midſt of the children of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> Which the Lord proclaimeth when his glory was returned to the renewed Temple, as is apparent in the verſes immediately preceding. And ſo the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a Throne high, and lifted up, and his Traine filled the Temple, &amp;c. And the houſe was filled with ſmoake, &amp;c. Eſay</hi> 6.1, 4. Where he chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctereth the Lords ſitting parallel to his dwelling in the cloud of glory upon the Arke, and from thence filling the whole houſe with the traine of his glory. And ſo in the booke of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> where the Lord is inthroned, with ſuch living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures attending him as are deſcribed here, there are ſo plaine intimations, that it meaneth his glory at his Temple, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be plainer: for when there is mention of a Sea of Glaſſe before the Throne, and of ſeven Lamps, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. and of a golden Altar of incenſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.3. and of a voice from that Altar, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the alluſion is ſo cleare to the molten Sea, ſeven Lamps of the golden Candleſtick, the Altar of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and the Oracle given from beyond it, which all were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke where the Lords glory dwelt in the cloud, that the matter needeth no more proofe then only to obſerve this:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49920:134"/>And that the throne and glory of God throughout all that deſcription meaneth in this ſenſe, there is evidence enough in that one clauſe in <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 17. a voice came out of the <hi>Temple</hi> of heaven from the <hi>Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Ezekiel</hi> himſelfe ſheweth that this glory referred to the Temple, becauſe he hath ſhewed it pitched there, flitting thence and returning thither againe. 1 He ſaith, that the glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was at the Temple, namely, that that he had ſeene and deſcribed in the firſt chapter, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.4. though he be there in numbring up the abominations that were committed in the Temple, which were great and many, yet doth he relate that this glory was there ſtill, becauſe the Lord had not yet withdrawne his preſence thence. But 2 At the laſt the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in that place do cauſe it to depart; and that departure he deſcribeth in the tenth chapter, and there he ſetteth forth the very ſame glory, and almoſt in the very ſame termes that he doth in the firſt chapter. He telleth that this glory of the Lord departed <hi>from off the Cherub,</hi> that is, from off the Mercy ſeat, where it had alwayes dwelt between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and went out, firſt to the threſhold, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. then to the Eaſt gate, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. then to the City and to the Mount Olivet and ſo departs, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.23. But 3 When he ſpeaketh of and deſcribeth a new Temple, then he ſheweth his glory returned thither againe, <hi>chap.</hi> 43.2, 3, 4. And upon theſe three particulars of its pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Temple, flitting thence and returning thither again, we may take up theſe obſervations for the further clearing of this ſignification.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the Prophet maketh ſome diſtinction betwixt the glory of the Lord dwelling upon the <hi>Cherub,</hi> that is, on the Mercy ſeat, over the Arke, and the glory of the Lord upon theſe Cherubims: for he ſaith the <hi>glory of the Lord went up from the Cherub, and ſtood ever the threſhold of the houſe,</hi> theſe Cherubims then ſtanding on the right ſide of the houſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.3, 4. and then that the glory of the Lord departed from off the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of the houſe, and ſtood over the Cherubims, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. The glory of the Lord in the repreſentation that the Prophet deſcribeth in the firſt chapter was upon the Cherubims already, for he ſaith the glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was there according
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49920:135"/>to the viſion that I ſaw in the plaine, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.4. and yet he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth another glory now added to it: namely, the cloud of glory that dwelt upon the Mercy ſeat, for he ſaith that upon the flitting of that glory from off the Cherub to the threſhold, the houſe was filled with the cloud; the meaning of this we ſhall looke at afterward.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As to the flitting of this glory from the Temple, the Prophet ſaith he ſaw it when he came to deſtroy the City, <hi>chap.</hi> 43.3. that is, when he came to foretell that the City ſhould be deſtroyed. And he dated the time of his firſt ſeeing of this glory, in the fifth yeare of the captivity of <hi>Jehoiakim, chap.</hi> 1.2. which was the fifth yeare of the reigne of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.8, 17, 18. in which very yeare <hi>Zedekiah</hi> did rebell againſt the King of <hi>Babel,</hi> which action was the very beginning of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 As to the returning of this flitted glory againe to the new built Temple, <hi>chap.</hi> 43. it is obſervable that the cloud of glory which had deſcended and filled the Tabernacle, and had done the like at <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, did never ſo at the ſecond Temple, or that built after the Captivity, as the Jewes themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and that not without, good reaſon: Yet doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as clearly bring that glory into his new Temple, as ever it had come into them: but onely that this was in a viſion, and ſo it ſhewed viſionarily, the Lords dwelling in his Ordinances and preſence among his people under the ſecond Temple, unto which the People returned out of <hi>Babel,</hi> and in the ſpirituall Temple or Church under the Goſpell (for <hi>Ezekiels</hi> new Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple promiſed a bodily Temple to the returned, and promiſed, and typified a ſpirituall Temple under the Goſpell) even as he had done viſibly in his cloud of glory, in the Tabernacle and firſt Temple. And 2 he addeth further, that when that glory was entered, the Eaſt gate at which it came in, was ſhut and never opened after, <hi>chap.</hi> 44.2. to denote the Everlaſting dwelling of the Lord in the Church of the Goſpell among his people, and never departing as hee had done from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>This then being the ſignification of this appearance and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in generall, we are next to look upon the particulars of it,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49920:135"/>which will more fully alſo confirme and cleare this matter, and firſt we will beginne with the <hi>living Creatures,</hi> or <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better diſcovery of them what they were, and what they meant, theſe things do deſervedly challenge ſpeciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering and obſervation.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That they are plainly diſtinguiſhed from Angels: For in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11. there is mention <hi>of many Angels round about the Throne and about the living Creatures, and the number of them was ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands:</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.11. <hi>All the Angels ſtood round about the Throne, and about the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the foure living Creatures:</hi> So that here is apparent difference between Angels and living Creatures both in their names and in their placing: For the living Creatures were about the Throne, the 24 Elders about the living Creatures, and the innumerable multitude of Angels about all.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That they were ſuch as Chriſt redeemed from the earth; For obſerve in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>The four living Creatures</hi> as well as the <hi>four and twenty Elders fall downe before the Lamb, &amp;c.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thou waſt ſlaine and haſt redeemed us to God by thy bloud, out of every kindred and tongue, and people and Nation, and haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts &amp;c.</hi> So that the living Creatures were redeemed, and were of people and Nations, and were made Kings and Prieſts as well as the 24 Elders, which cannot be applied to Angels.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That theſe <hi>living Creatures</hi> or <hi>Cherubims</hi> are never menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned but in viſion or <hi>Hicroglyphick;</hi> In viſion, as in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that have been cited of <hi>Eſay, Ezekiel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and in <hi>Hieroglyphicke,</hi> as the <hi>Cherubims</hi> covering the Arke, and wrought in the Tabernacle Curtaines, and on the Temple wais. It is true indeed that it is ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. God placed <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims</hi> at the gate of <hi>Eden,</hi> which is onely for the fuller and more feeling apprehenſion of the thing, the <hi>Cherubims</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch formes as with which the people were beſt acquainted ſeeing them in the Tabernacle curtaines.</p>
               <p n="4">4 They therefore being thus conſtantly held out in a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall and ſignificative tenour, as viſions and <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> are, they are to be expounded to ſuch a doctrinall and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49920:136"/>ſenſe, and ſo is the whole body of glory, as I may ſo call it, the whole viſionary theatre or ſpectacle that is before us to be taken.</p>
               <p>And firſt to begin with the quadrature or four-ſquare poſture of the whole appearance, which was touched before, and now a little more to be conſidered on. There is intimation enough in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that the four living Creatures ſtood ſquare, with a fire in the middeſt of them, and the wheeles in a ſquare on the outſide of the ſquare of the living Creatures: but in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> it is yet more plaine, for there it is ſaid the foure living Creatures ſtood round about the Throne, which could not be but in a quadrature, one before, another behinde, and one of either ſide; for how elſe could foure ſtand round about it? The Throne then meaning the Temple as was ſhewed before, this double quadrature about it, doth call us to remember the double camp that pitched about the Tabernacle upon the four ſides of it, Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South: When the Lord did firſt platforme and order the incamping of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He pitched his owne Tabernacle in the middle, as that being the very Center, heart, and life of the Congregation, and they being all to attend upon it, and God thereby declaring himſelfe to be in the middeſt of them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.11, 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He pitched the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> in foure ſquadrons on the four ſides of the Tabernacle next unto it: for they being the Miniſters that attended upon the publick ſervice, and that drew neare unto the Lord, and were Mediators 'twixt God and his people, the Lord cauſed them to incampe next unto his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and betwixt the Camp of the people and himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The outmoſt of all, in four main bodies on the foure ſides of the Tabernacle, and of the <hi>Levites</hi> Camp, did the whole Congregation pitch, and ſo there were two quadratures, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es about the Sanctuary and the Congregation about the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Anſwerable is the platforme here, and the quadrangular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is in reference and alluſion to that, and from thence muſt we explain it. In the midſt was a quadrangle of fire: and upon every ſide of that quadrangle a <hi>Cherub,</hi> and on the outſide of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49920:136"/>the <hi>Cherubims</hi> even before every one of them was a wheel. And in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> A Throne in the middle, foure living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures next about it, and the 24 Elders about them.</p>
               <p>So that by this parallel to <hi>Iſraels</hi> Camp from whence the platforme both in the Prophet and the Apocalyptick is taken, the foure living Creatures did ſignifie the Prieſts and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Lord, and the wheels in the one, and the 24 El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the other did repreſent the people or the Congregation: And this will ariſe clearer and clearer ſtill to our obſervation, as wegoe along to conſider their place, actions and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="1">1 I know it is conceived by ſome that the 24 Elders in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is ſaid the glory of the Lord ſtood over the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 1.22, 26. &amp;c. It is ſaid the Throne of God was juſt over their heads, and there is no mention of being over the wheeles, which ſhews it very unlikely that the wheels were in the middle of the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims.</hi> 4 In <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6. the platform is named thus, <hi>In the midſt of the Throne, and of the four living Creatures, and in the midſt of the Elders;</hi> the Throne in the midſt, the living Creatures next, and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders outmoſt: and ſo againe in <hi>v.</hi> 11. &amp;c. 5 In <hi>chap.</hi> 4.4. It is ſaid that <hi>about the Throne were four and twenty ſeats, and on them four and twenty Elders ſitting;</hi> and at <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, <hi>between the Throne and the incompaſſing that was about it</hi> (of 24 ſeats and Elders on them) <hi>there were four living Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then was the place of the <hi>living Creatures,</hi> next the Throne; and that being the place of the Levites next the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, it ſheweth that theſe <hi>Cherubims</hi> or Creatures, did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Miniſters and the wheeles, and 24 Elders did repreſent the Congregation.</p>
               <p>And this will yet appeare the clearer by obſerving that the living Creatures were the firſt agents and movers continually in any expedition or imploiment, as the Miniſters were in the publick ſervice. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. &amp; 10. the wheels moved or ſtood, according as the living Creatures did firſt.

               <p>Upon the obſervation that theſe repreſentations were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the ſtandards of <hi>Iſraels</hi> campe, ſome have concluded, that therefore the foure living creatures which bare theſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations did ſignifie the Congregation or people, and not the Levites or Miniſters: which is unproper to conceive, becauſe ſuch a conſtruction allotteth all the foure figures to every ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, whereas all the foure ſtandards did but make up and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry theſe foure figures amongſt them all. But it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to allot all theſe foure figures to every one of the ſquadrons of the <hi>Levites,</hi> for every one of them, nay every particular one of the Prieſts and Levites had intereſt in and relation to the whole Congregation, as being Miniſters in their behalf: And as <hi>Aaron</hi> carried all the tribes upon his ſhoulders and breaſt, ſo are the Miniſters in theſe emblemes of the living creatures, decyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as carrying the faces of all the ſtandards of the whole Congregation: becauſe of their reference to the whole Congregation, they ſerving at the Temple for it. What allegoricall interpretations are made of theſe foure faces, I ſhall not trouble the reader to produce, every one may finde one ſuch application of them or other as his conception upon them ſhall lead him to it.</p>
               <p>As for the reſt of the proportion of theſe living Creatures, they are eſpecially remarkable for their wings and feet, for the reſt of their bodies was like the body of a man: Two of their wings were alwaies erect over their heads covering their faces, from under which they ſpied as it were at their way they were to goe, and at the glory they attended on: which pertinently denoteth the reverentiall reſpect that the Miniſters of the Lord have to his glory and to the myſteries of his counſell; compare 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. With two other wings they covered their ſecrets, in ſigne of humble ſenſibleneſſe of their owne deformity, and with two they flew, in ſignification of ready activity and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance for and upon the Lords ſervice; their feet were in faſhion like to the feet of a bullocke, and in colour like to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed braſſe: according to which latter character the feet of our Saviour are deſcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.15. <hi>His feet like unto fine braſſe as if they burned in a furnace.</hi> Every one will be ready to frame an allegoricall application of theſe circumſtances, according to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49920:138"/>his owne conception: It may be ſome (if they take thoſe living creatures to repreſent the Miniſters as I ſuppoſe they do) will when they read of <hi>their feet like to the feet of bullocks,</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that it is, becauſe they trod out the corne of the word for the people; and as that was alſo done with a wheele, ſo there are wheeles here in the like manner: It may be they will thinke they are deſcribed thus footed for the fitter ſetting them forth as the drawers of this divine charret. It may be they will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the beauty and ſhining brightneſſe of their feet, may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the holineſſe of their waies ſhining in ſanctity and burning in zeale: It may be they may thinke of the Prieſts feet red for cold as they ſtood upon the bare ſtones in their ſervice, and they ſeeming unſenſible of it as are the feet of bullocks, and ſuch variety of apprehenſions will be ready to be taken up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things, that a man may ſpeake his owne thoughts and opinion in this matter, but not readily bring another to be of his minde,</p>
               <p>The likeneſſe of theſe living creatures all over their bodies, was <hi>as burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lampes Ezek.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 13. for the faithful miniſters of the Lord are as a flame of fire, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.4 ſhining in life and doctrine like lampes and lights, <hi>Iob.</hi> 5.35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14, 15, 16. and by the word of the Lord even devouring the diſobedient, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.14. <hi>I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood and it ſhall devoure them.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall not be curious to inquire whether <hi>Nob</hi> were any of the foure cities that were allotted at the firſt diviſion, to the Prieſts, out of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin, Joſh.</hi> 21.17, 18. or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were of a latter poſſeſſion (as <hi>Ramah</hi> was to the Levites of the ſtock of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.1.) or if <hi>Nob</hi> were one of thoſe foure firſt cities (and the ſame with <hi>Almon,</hi> for the other three are clearly diſtinguiſhed from it, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 10.29, 30.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.30) whether it were <hi>Baburim,</hi> which the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphraſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly rendreth <hi>Alemeth,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Almon</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.60.

               <p>If the Tabernacle removed to <hi>Nob</hi> preſently upon the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Arke from <hi>Shiloh,</hi> it reſided there about 37 yeares, all which time <hi>Samuel</hi> is alive, and ſeeth both the fall of <hi>Shiloh</hi> and the fall of <hi>Nob,</hi> and it may very well be, he was the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of the Tabernacle from <hi>Shiloh</hi> to <hi>Nob,</hi> and from <hi>Nob</hi> to <hi>Gibeon: In the time of its reſidence in both theſe places high places were permitted</hi> (as the <hi>Talmud</hi> conceiveth in the place cited even now) <hi>and the moſt holy things were eaten within the curtaines and the leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in any city of Iſrael.</hi>

The Commentators ſpoken of, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this improbability will heale the matter with as impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49920:141"/>a gloſſe: Seventy men (ſay they) which were valuable, every one to fifty thouſand; and others retaining the ſcruple ſtill, doe raiſe it higher by their interpretation, for the fifty thouſand men (ſay they) were every one of them valuable to the ſeventy men in the <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi> The text doth plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of the perſons, for it ſaith, <hi>that he ſmote of the men of Bethſhemeſh</hi> becauſe they looked into the Arke, <hi>and he ſmote of the people:</hi> For the returne of the Arke had occaſioned no doubt the concourſe of the people all about, beſides the inhabitants of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> (it was now upon the time of the feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles when the Arke came up to them, and it may be that might cauſe the more conflux to the Arke when it was come) and the Lord for the boldneſſe of Prieſts and people that would be looking into the Arke, breaketh out upon them with the plague, and deſtroyeth ſo many thouſands of them.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> that had eſcaped, ſent to the men of <hi>Kiriathjearim</hi> to fetch up the Arke to them, and ſo they doe. It is equally queſtionable, why they that were Prieſts ſhould ſend about ſuch a matter as this to the men of <hi>Kiriathjearim</hi> which were not, and that the men of <hi>Kiriathjearim</hi> ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to fetch up the Arke, when they had ſeen the ſpeeding of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> by it: But the Lord had now forſaken the tribe of <hi>Ephraine,</hi> in which tribe <hi>Shiloh</hi> ſtood, and had made choice of the tribe of <hi>Judah Pſal.</hi> 78.67, 68. of which <hi>Kiriathjearim</hi> was a chief city: and whether he uſed the counſell of <hi>Samuel</hi> to the the people for a means to accompliſh his determination, or what other way, is not determinable, but it is brought to paſſe, and the Arke now ſeated in the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> out of which it never unſetled againe whileſt it was in being.</p>
               <p>A long time whileſt it ſtayed in <hi>Kiriathjearim</hi> it was under the curbe of, <hi>Philiſtine</hi> garriſon which was in that city 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5. which might much dampe the peoples ſeeking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting to it, eſpecially in this looſeneſſe and lukewarmeneſſe, or rather utter coldneſſe of religion that was amongſt them. However, at the end of twenty yeares a generall reformation doth begin amongſt them, and they begin to hearken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, the Arke and religion, and put away the ſtrange gods that were among them, and God at that very inſtant
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49920:142"/>doth grant them a miraculous victory againſt the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>We read once of the Arkes being within the compaſſe of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> before <hi>David</hi> fetched it up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that was with <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Gibeah</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.18. but it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored from thence to <hi>Kiriathjearim</hi> as the place appointed for it as yet, by divine direction, for otherwiſe it might as eaſily have been ſet up in <hi>Nob</hi> where the Tabernacle was now ſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> about the ſecond yeare of his reigne in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> fetcheth it up from <hi>Kiriathjearim</hi> thither, and there pitched an habitation for it in <hi>Sion,</hi> where it reſided till it was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, ſave onely that once it was taken out to have flitted with <hi>David</hi> in his flight from his ſon <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> but ſoone reſtored to its place againe. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. At this Tabernacle in which the Arke was lodged in <hi>Sion David</hi> ſets up an Altar, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.2. for the offerings at that preſent time of the Arkes bringing up thither, but not for continuall ſacrificing: And there he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a conſtant muſicke to attend, of the Levites, but the Prieſts waited at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> where the Tabernacle was and the daily ſacrifice.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramah</hi> where <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſpent ſome time together, they platfsormed the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Temple and the manner of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: It was an unlikely time for <hi>David</hi> to thinke and contrive for ſuch a thing at that time, when he knew not where to hide his own head from the fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> yet ſo ſure was the promiſe to him, and ſo aſſured was his faith in it, that even from that time he laid the foundation of his thoughts towards the building of a Temple, ſetling of a ſervice, and even all his time after was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring towards it. In all his wars and victories he ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to dedicate ſomething of his ſpoiles for that purpoſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.10, 11. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.8, &amp;c. ſo that at his death he left the greateſt ſums of ſilver and gold, and ſtock of braſſe and iron and ſuch materials that is recorded in any ſtory: And as he had his firſt inſtructions from <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſo did he ripen then by the propheticke directions of <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophets, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25. and ſo ſetled the Prieſts and Levites in their courſes, and carpenters and maſons to worke, and had deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the platforme of all thingsſo exactly, that he leſt to <hi>Solomon</hi> in a manner but the care to ſee the worke done, for he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all things before.</p>
               <p>About eleven or twelve years ſpace was the worke of the Temple in hand, before it was finiſhed, namely foure yeares in hewing ſtone and framing timber, and ſeven years and an half in bringing up the building: For <hi>David</hi> in the laſt year of his reign hath gathered all the proſelytes in the land to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 153000 and had ſet them to worke, and ſo they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued framing and preparing materialls till the fourth yeare of the reigne of <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the ſecond moneth of which yeare the foundation of the houſe was laid, and in the eight moneth of his eleventh yeare the worke was finiſhed, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.38. and ſo
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49920:143"/>it was ſeven yeares and an halfe in building, which the text for roundneſſe of number doth count but ſeven.</p>
               <p>It was a yeare within a moneth after that it was finiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dedication of it, in which time it is likely, they were getting away the rubbiſh, and preparing for its conſecration, it lying uſeleſſe all the while, for the providence of the Lord diſpoſed that it ſhould be dedicated at ſuch a time, as that the time ſhould carry a myſtery and type with it, as well as the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it ſelfe.

I need not to illuſtrate: Thus was the Temple dedicate and the ſervice of it began <hi>anno mundi</hi> 3001.</p>
               <p>At the dedication of it, both the books of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> informe us, that the Tabernacle of the Congregation and all the holy veſſels that had been in the Tabernacle were brought up thither, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.4. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.5. But the queſtion is, What became of them there, were they uſed on were they
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49920:143"/>laid up? There are that aſſert either way: and the latter ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the more probable, namely that theſe things of <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon the riſing of a greater and more eminent glory, did decay and were laid aſide, as all his Ceremonies were to doe upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The Temple though it were of a heavenly reſemblance, uſe and concernment, as figuring <hi>Chriſts</hi> body, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. enjoying Gods preſence, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.16. and <hi>Iſraels</hi> worſhip, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.4. &amp;c. yet being but an earthly building it was ſubject to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall condition of earthly things, caſualty and changing: Nay there is hardly any ſtate or place in any ſtory, of which may be found more viciſſitudes and alterations of condition then of this: and there is hardly any Kings time of all thoſe that reigned in the time of the Temple, in which it received not ſome remarkable alteration of eſtate or other. In the time of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> that built it, it received that vile affront of an Idol Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple built by him in the face of it, and what became of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Temple in theſe times may be ſhrewdly ſuſpected: In his ſonne <hi>Rehoboams</hi> time, it was firſt forſaken by the ten tribes, and afterward by <hi>Judah</hi> it ſelfe, who fell to Idolatry, and then it was plundred by <hi>Shiſhak.</hi> How oft the Treaſuries of it were plundred ſometimes by forainers, ſometimes by their owne Kings, how oft it ſelfe prophaned, as by <hi>Athaliah, Abaz, Manaſſeh,</hi> how the ſervice of it either totally ſlighted, or ſlightly performed, how Idols ſet up in it, &amp; Altars to ſtrange gods: how the blood of the High-prieſt ſhed, and the manners of the Prieſts corrupt, and the houſe of prayer made a den of theeves, as alſo how ſometimes againe it was repaired, the ſervice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, the Prieſts reformed, and matters amended with it, is ſo plainly and copiouſly deſcribed in the bookes of Scripture, that it were but tranſcription of the text to recite them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. At laſt it had run out its date, and it ſelfe fired and all its precious veſſells were captived by the <hi>Babylonian:</hi> what became of the Arke the Scripture doth not mention, the Jewes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it was hid, in ſome vault that they ſay <hi>Solomon</hi> had purpoſely made againſt ſuch a time, where it eſcaped the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors fury: but this we leave to their owne credit.</p>
               <p>The time of the ſtanding of this firſt Temple from its finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49920:144"/>in the eleventh yeare of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to its firing by <hi>Nebuzara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> was 420 years.</p>

                  <p>ALthough between the returne out of the Babylonian cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and the finall deſolation of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> there might ſeeme to be ſtrictly and literally two Temples, that of <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> and that of <hi>Herod,</hi> (for <hi>Herod</hi> began his Temple from the very foundation) yet do the Scriptures, and all Jewiſh writers ſo unanimouſly and generally own them but for one Temple, calling it the <hi>ſecond Temple</hi> all the time there was a Temple af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its firſt building under <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that it would be but needleſs labour and unwarrantable curioſity to take up any other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſtinction of it. For though the Temple built by <hi>Zorobabel</hi> were pulled down to the very ground by <hi>Herod,</hi> when he built that fabrick that ſtood to the laſt fate of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet ſince that demolition was not by deſtruction and ruine, but for reparation and for its bettering, there is no reaſon to reckon theſe as two ſeverall Temples, but as one Temple firſt built and then repaired to a more excellent and glorious condition.</p>
                  <p>From the firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus</hi> (in which he proclaimed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to the Captives, and gave commandment to reſtore and build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) to the death of Chriſt were 490 years, as they be ſummed by an Angel, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and from the death of Chriſt to the fatall and finall deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were 40 yeares more, 530 yeares in all. In all which time it were endleſſe to ſhew every particular occurrence, and change of condition that befell the Temple, and it would require a large ſtory and volume: I ſhall therefore onely touch upon the chiefeſt, diſtributing the times into thoſe ſeverall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable periods that they fell into, and applying the ſtories to the times accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The firſt parcell of this time was taken up by the <hi>Perſian</hi>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:49920:144"/>Monarchy, which how long it continued, and for how many Kings Succeſſion, is a thing of as diſputable and controverted a nature, as any one thing in Chronology: I will keep to the number and names of the Kings of that Throne that we find in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.2. there are theſe words: <hi>Behold there ſhall ſtand up yet three Kings in Perſia, and the fourth ſhall be far richer then they all: and by his ſtrength through his riches he ſhall ſtir up all againſt the Re In of Grecia. And a mighty King ſhall ſtand up, &amp;c. And when he ſhall ſtand up his Kingdome ſhall be broken, and ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided toward the four winds of Heaven, and not to his poſterity, &amp;c.</hi> It is obſervable concerning this propheſie and account about the Perſian Monarchy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That this was told <hi>Daniel</hi> in the third yeare of <hi>Cyrus chap.</hi> 10.1. and ſo when he ſaith, <hi>There ſhall ſtand up yet three Kings, and the fourth, &amp;c.</hi> he meaneth foure beſides <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the firſt beginner of the Kingdome; and therefore ſome of the Jewes do make but a croſſe reckoning upon this place, who will have <hi>Cyrus</hi> which was the firſt, to be meant by this that is called the <hi>fourth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Propheſie ſpeaketh of the length of the Perſian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, till it brings it up to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, the deſtroyer of that Monarchy, of whom it ſpeaketh plainly, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. and of his Succeſſors afterward, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There were therefore, by the account of the Angell here, but five Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> namely, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and four more.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 That <hi>Nehemiah</hi> lived quite through the whole length of the Perſian Monarchy, being at mans eſtate the firſt yeare of it, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 2.2. and ſeeing <hi>Darius</hi> its laſt King, and probably his laſt times, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12.12.

                  <p>In the firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the returned Captires out of <hi>Babel</hi> onely built an Altar, and ſacrificed thereon for ſeven months together having yet no Temple: but in this ſeeond year, the ſecond moneth of that yeare they lay the foundation of the houſe, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.8, &amp;c. the progreſſe of which work is ſoon oppoſed, and indeavoured to be made fruſtrate by the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> all the time of <hi>Cyrus, Ezra</hi> 4.5. but in his time they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not.</p>

                     <hi>Darius</hi> ſucceeded him, called alſo <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezr.</hi> 6.1. &amp; 7.1. &amp;c. In his ſecond yeare the building goes on againe, and is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in his ſixth, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.14. And thus had the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lien waſte and deſolate juſt ſeventy years, from the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> in which year it was fired, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Darius,</hi> when it began to be wrought upon ſo as that it came to perfection, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.12. &amp; 4.3, 5.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeventh yeare of this <hi>Darius,</hi> which was the year after the Temple was finiſhed, <hi>Ezra</hi> cometh up, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.8. and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yeares after, namely, in the twentieth yeare of this <hi>Darius</hi> (called alſo <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>) <hi>Nehemiah</hi> cometh up to <hi>Jeruſalem, Neh.</hi> 1.1. and both help to repair, ſettle and rectifie, Temple, City, and people, as their ſtory is at large in their owne bookes.</p>
                  <p>In the two and thirtieth year of this <hi>Darius, Nehemiah</hi> having finiſhed what he had to doe, about the building, beautifying, and ſettling of City, Temple and people, he returneth againe unto the King, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.6. and here ends <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt parcell of his ſeventy weekes, namely, ſeven weekes in which ſtreet and wall ſhould be built, and that in troublous times, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. By ſeven weeks he meaneth ſeven times ſeven yeares which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to nine and forty: and ſo there were hitherto; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 3 of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> 14 of <hi>Ahaſhueroſh,</hi> and 32 of <hi>Darius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After <hi>Darius</hi> there reigned <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> commonly known in heathen ſtories by the name of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the invader of <hi>Greece</hi> with his huge army, &amp;c. He was a favourer of the Jews at the

                  <p>Yet did there an unhappy occurrence befall in this Kings time in the Temple it ſelfe, which if it did not alienate and change his affection from well-willing to it, yet did it preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Temple in the affection of him that was chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander under this King in thoſe parts, whoſe name was <hi>Bago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> The occaſion was this;<note n="[a]" place="margin">Ioſeph.

He had taken indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at <hi>Iaddua</hi> the High-prieſt, <hi>Neh.</hi> 12.22. becauſe he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him aſſiſtance at the ſiege of <hi>Tyrus</hi> (for <hi>Jaddua</hi> had ſworn fealty to <hi>Darius.</hi>) Hereupon he cometh up towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> breathing fire and fury againſt it, till he came within the ſight of the City: There he was met by <hi>Jaddua</hi> in the High-prieſts garments, and by all the Prieſts in their veſtments and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in white: whom when he came neare, in ſtead of offering them violence, he ſhewed reverence to the <hi>High-prieſt</hi> and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly ſaluted all the people.</p>

                  <p>As for the paſſages there, that are not mentioned in the Scripture, but by <hi>Joſephus</hi> and others, as <hi>Pilates</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beedlling the holy Treaſures of the Temple upon an aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, <hi>Petronius</hi> his going about to bring in <hi>Caligulaes</hi> Image thither, a tumult cauſed there by the baſe irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a <hi>Romane</hi> ſouldier, <hi>Agrippa's</hi> Sacrifices there, and <hi>Anathemata, Vitellius</hi> his favour to it and the people, a baſe affront and abuſe put upon the place by the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes,</hi> the horrid confuſions there in the time of the ſeditious, the ſlaughter of one <hi>Zacharias</hi> in it, and at the laſt the firing of it by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the utter ruine of it and the City, they would require a larger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, then one chapter or paragraph will afford, it may be they will come to bee proſecuted to the full in another Treatiſe, and therefore I ſhall but onely name them here.</p>
